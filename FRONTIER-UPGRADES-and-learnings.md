# moverrr — Frontier Upgrades And Learnings

Last revised: 5 April 2026 (Sydney)

> Status note (5 April 2026): this file remains the active frontier backlog. Completed work from the current frontier sweep was moved to `completed.md` under `COMP-2026-04-02-36`, `COMP-2026-04-02-37`, `COMP-2026-04-02-38`, and `COMP-2026-04-05-39`. Treat `completed.md` as the source of truth for what shipped; keep unresolved or future frontier work here until it is actually implemented.

## What This First Half Is

This first half converts lessons mainly from:

- `claude code src/CLAUDE_CODE_50_LESSONS.md`
- `claude code src/CLAUDE_CODE_DETAILED_PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md`
- `claw-code-main- src/README.md`
- `claw-code-main- src/PARITY.md`
- `autoresearch/README.md`
- `autoresearch/program.md`

into implementation-ready tasks for moverrr's agent operating system.

This is not about cloning Claude Code.
It is about stealing the highest-signal harness, workflow, verification, and operating-discipline ideas, then translating them into tasks that fit moverrr.

## Product Truth We Must Protect

Before any frontier-style improvement gets built, ask:

1. Does this make moverrr better at being a browse-first spare-capacity marketplace?
2. Does this help carriers post real supply faster?
3. Does this make customer trust or clarity stronger?
4. Does this reduce founder ops pain without adding fake complexity?
5. Does this avoid drifting into dispatch, bidding, quote comparison, or removalist workflows?

If not, do not build it yet.

## Why These Lessons Matter

The strongest Claude Code lessons are not "use a smarter model."
They are:

1. separate explore, plan, implement, and verify
2. make instructions layered and local
3. treat tools as governed capabilities, not random helpers
4. make verification adversarial and explicit
5. keep memory, tasks, and long-session work structured
6. use isolation and worktrees for parallelism instead of chaos
7. use keep/discard experiment loops instead of vague ideation

`autoresearch` adds one especially important founder lesson:

> establish a baseline, change one meaningful variable, measure, then explicitly keep or discard the result.

## How To Use This Half

Every task below follows one format:

- `What to do`: the smallest useful implementation
- `Why it matters`: why this helps moverrr
- `Done when`: the practical finish line

Priority labels:

- `Now`: worth doing soon because it improves leverage, clarity, trust, or verification
- `Soon`: valuable after the current instruction system is stable
- `Later`: useful, but not urgent yet

## 84 Actionable Frontier Tasks

## A. Instruction Architecture And Project Memory

1. **Instruction system map** (`Now`)
What to do: Add one short section to this file or a nearby repo doc that explains the purpose and precedence of `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/`, `.agent-skills/`, and `.claude/skills/`.
Why it matters: Claude Code's strongest markdown lesson is instruction layering with explicit precedence.
Done when: A future agent can answer "where should this truth live?" without guessing.

2. **Scoped rule coverage matrix** (`Now`)
What to do: Audit which important moverrr surfaces still do not have dedicated `.claude/rules/` coverage, especially search/matching, payouts, analytics, and admin ops.
Why it matters: The Claude Code material repeatedly shows that local instructions beat broad global prose.
Done when: There is a simple list of high-value missing rule files and their intended path scopes.

3. **Search and matching rule** (`Now`)
What to do: Create `.claude/rules/search-and-matching.md` for `src/lib/matching/**`, search APIs, and customer search UI.
Why it matters: Matching is product-shaping logic and should not rely on generic memory.
Done when: Search and matching work automatically loads route-fit, disqualifier, and explainability constraints.

4. **Payments and payouts rule** (`Now`)
What to do: Create `.claude/rules/payments-and-payouts.md` for payment intent, webhook, payout, and ledger files.
Why it matters: Funds flow is one of the highest-risk product areas and deserves narrower memory.
Done when: Payment-related changes automatically load payout timing, trust, and reconciliation guidance.

5. **Supabase schema rule** (`Now`)
What to do: Create `.claude/rules/supabase-schema.md` for `supabase/**` and `src/types/database.ts`.
Why it matters: The fuller Claude material shows how much runtime quality depends on strong typed contracts and explicit schema discipline.
Done when: Migration, RPC, RLS, rollback, and type-sync expectations are local to schema work.

6. **Analytics and metrics rule** (`Soon`)
What to do: Create `.claude/rules/analytics-and-metrics.md` so future analytics changes stay tied to core marketplace questions.
Why it matters: Tooling and event systems become noisy fast when no metric layer exists.
Done when: Analytics tasks have a local instruction file that says what moverrr actually measures and why.

7. **Customer-trust rule** (`Soon`)
What to do: Create `.claude/rules/customer-trust.md` for trip detail, pricing presentation, saved-search empty states, and confirmation flows.
Why it matters: The frontier harness lesson is to move deep context close to the work.
Done when: Customer-facing trust, pricing, and reassurance surfaces load a specific trust-focused rule.

8. **Carrier-growth rule** (`Soon`)
What to do: Create `.claude/rules/carrier-growth.md` for onboarding, posting, templates, and carrier dashboard flows.
Why it matters: Carrier activation is moverrr's most important growth loop and deserves its own scoped memory.
Done when: Supply-side work automatically loads activation, repeat-posting, and speed-to-listing priorities.

9. **Admin-operations rule** (`Soon`)
What to do: Create `.claude/rules/admin-operations.md` for admin dashboard, disputes, verification, and ops tooling.
Why it matters: Manual-first marketplace ops are a real subsystem, not a generic admin afterthought.
Done when: Admin and ops changes inherit queue, trust, and exception-handling guidance automatically.

10. **Docs precedence note** (`Now`)
What to do: Write a short explicit precedence rule for what wins when two instructions conflict.
Why it matters: The detailed Claude analysis makes clear that instruction layering without precedence becomes ambiguous.
Done when: There is one canonical answer for conflict resolution across memory layers.

11. **Rule naming convention** (`Now`)
What to do: Standardize how new `.claude/rules/` files should be named and how narrow their `paths` frontmatter should be.
Why it matters: Claude Code's memory system works because locality is deliberate.
Done when: New rule files follow a repeatable naming and scoping standard.

12. **Include/import policy for docs** (`Soon`)
What to do: Define when docs may reference other files and what kinds of files are safe to include conceptually.
Why it matters: The Claude memory loader treats include power carefully because uncontrolled inclusion creates context and trust problems.
Done when: The repo has a small written policy for composable docs without turning every file into a context dump.

## B. Skills, Commands, And Reusable Workflows

13. **Skill inventory audit** (`Now`)
What to do: Review existing `.claude/skills/` and identify which are true repeatable workflows versus just good reference notes.
Why it matters: The Claude skill system treats workflows and references as different things.
Done when: Every existing skill either has a clear workflow role or is moved to a better home later.

14. **Release-readiness skill** (`Now`)
What to do: Create a `release-readiness` skill for final doc, verification, key-flow, and open-risk review before any serious deploy.
Why it matters: Claude Code turns "ship checks" into explicit workflows instead of vibes.
Done when: A future agent can run one repeatable release-readiness process instead of improvising one.

15. **Dispute-resolution-audit skill** (`Now`)
What to do: Create a skill specifically for changes touching disputes, proof review, admin resolution, or status guard logic.
Why it matters: High-risk flows deserve high-specificity workflows.
Done when: Dispute work has a repeatable verification and review runbook.

16. **Saved-search-demand-review skill** (`Now`)
What to do: Create a skill that reads saved-search demand and turns it into supply, copy, and ops recommendations.
Why it matters: Demand signals are easy to collect and easy to waste.
Done when: There is one repeatable way to interpret saved-search demand in moverrr terms.

17. **Carrier-quality-review skill** (`Soon`)
What to do: Create a skill for reviewing weak listings, poor proof quality, or low-trust carrier surfaces.
Why it matters: Marketplace quality work repeats and should not be reinvented every time.
Done when: Listing-quality audits can be run from one standard skill.

18. **Admin-queue-review skill** (`Soon`)
What to do: Create a skill for auditing the current admin queue: disputes, verification, stuck bookings, payout blockers, and urgent follow-ups.
Why it matters: A one-founder ops surface benefits from a repeatable daily or weekly review loop.
Done when: Admin review can be run from one skill with a clear output structure.

19. **Metrics-review skill** (`Soon`)
What to do: Create a skill that reads current marketplace metrics and returns decisions, not just summaries.
Why it matters: The frontier lesson is that output format matters; decisions beat dashboards.
Done when: Metrics review always ends with interpretation, recommended actions, and known uncertainty.

20. **Copy-guardian skill** (`Soon`)
What to do: Create a skill that audits customer and carrier copy for drift into quote-engine, dispatch, or removalist language.
Why it matters: Product-shape drift often happens through copy first.
Done when: Messaging can be reviewed against moverrr's wedge from one reusable workflow.

21. **Postmortem skill** (`Soon`)
What to do: Create a skill for writing postmortems after broken bookings, payment issues, trust incidents, or production regressions.
Why it matters: Strong frontier systems operationalize learning loops after failure.
Done when: Incidents can be documented in one consistent, action-oriented format.

22. **Experiment-design skill** (`Soon`)
What to do: Create a skill that formats product or ops experiments with baseline, single change, metric, and keep/discard rule.
Why it matters: This is the clearest `autoresearch` lesson to steal.
Done when: New experiments stop being vague enhancement ideas and become bounded tests.

23. **Verifier skill per surface** (`Now`)
What to do: Add separate verifier skills for core web UI, core API, and admin or ops surfaces.
Why it matters: The fuller Claude material shows that verification works best when surface-specific.
Done when: Verification is no longer one generic catch-all process.

24. **Command catalog for repo workflows** (`Soon`)
What to do: Create a small command or document catalog for repo-specific workflows, so future agents know what repeatable flows exist.
Why it matters: Claude Code benefits from explicit command surfaces instead of hidden workflows.
Done when: The repo has one discoverable place listing high-value workflows, skills, and where to use them.

## C. Agent Roles, Plan Mode, And Verification Discipline

25. **Product researcher agent** (`Now`)
What to do: Add an agent role dedicated to reading current behavior and translating it into product insight without editing code.
Why it matters: Claude Code separates read-heavy exploration from implementation for a reason.
Done when: Product research questions have a role that does not silently mutate the codebase.

26. **Payments verifier agent** (`Now`)
What to do: Add a role that specializes in payment, payout, webhook, and ledger verification.
Why it matters: High-stakes flows deserve narrower verification authority and stronger discipline.
Done when: Payment changes can be handed to a verifier that is purpose-built for the job.

27. **Mobile verifier agent** (`Now`)
What to do: Add a role focused on 375px checks, tap targets, proof uploads, and iPhone-specific behavior.
Why it matters: moverrr is iOS-first, so mobile verification should not be treated as generic frontend QA.
Done when: UI work has a verifier that thinks like an iPhone user first.

28. **Schema reviewer agent** (`Soon`)
What to do: Add a role for reviewing migrations, policies, RPC changes, and schema implications before merge.
Why it matters: The fuller Claude material emphasizes typed surfaces, parity checks, and runtime contracts.
Done when: Database changes have a designated reviewer role with clear scope.

29. **Copy guardian agent** (`Soon`)
What to do: Add an agent role that reviews product language, empty states, and trust messaging for wedge drift.
Why it matters: Product shape is often lost through tone and copy before logic changes.
Done when: Copy-sensitive tasks can be reviewed independently from implementation.

30. **Delegation triggers note** (`Now`)
What to do: Define exactly when moverrr work should spawn an explorer, verifier, or founder-critic style review.
Why it matters: Claude Code works because role usage is intentional, not random.
Done when: There is a written set of triggers for when specialized agents should be used.

31. **Plan-mode template for bigger tasks** (`Now`)
What to do: Create a standard plan template for medium or large tasks: problem, files, reuse candidates, risks, verification path.
Why it matters: The detailed Claude analysis shows that planning is a runtime state because it improves quality.
Done when: Bigger tasks consistently produce a useful plan artifact before implementation.

32. **Plan approval checklist** (`Soon`)
What to do: Define what a plan must answer before implementation begins on larger tasks.
Why it matters: A plan only helps if it is reviewable against explicit questions.
Done when: Plans are evaluated against the same checklist every time.

33. **Verification gate after 3+ subtasks** (`Now`)
What to do: Add a repo rule that any multi-step task with three or more major sub-parts must include an explicit verification step.
Why it matters: Claude Code literally nudges verification when task lists close without it.
Done when: Multi-part work cannot be called done without a verification lane.

34. **Reproduce-first bugfix rule** (`Now`)
What to do: Require every real bug fix to describe how the bug was reproduced before claiming it is fixed.
Why it matters: The verification agent pattern in Claude Code is built around evidence, not confidence.
Done when: Bugfix tasks always record reproduction, fix, and confirmation.

35. **Second-opinion pattern** (`Soon`)
What to do: Document when moverrr work should ask for an independent second opinion before merge, especially for pricing, booking, payments, and schema changes.
Why it matters: Fresh-agent review is one of the strongest Claude Code delegation lessons.
Done when: High-risk work has a defined trigger for independent review.

36. **Final summary format** (`Soon`)
What to do: Standardize the close-out format for future agent work: what changed, what was verified, what remains risky.
Why it matters: Claude Code's runtime is strong partly because completion is structured.
Done when: Final updates are consistent, verifiable, and easy to scan.

## D. Tooling, Capability Discovery, And Permission Rails

37. **Capability index** (`Now`)
What to do: Create a project-level inventory of what the repo's agent system can currently do: roles, skills, rules, verifiers, and repeatable workflows.
Why it matters: Claude Code includes tool discovery because large capability surfaces are hard to remember.
Done when: A future agent or human can quickly see the current operating-system surface of the repo.

38. **Tool semantics note** (`Soon`)
What to do: Define a small vocabulary for internal repo workflows: read-only, destructive, open-world, verification-only, or release-sensitive.
Why it matters: Claude Code attaches meaning to tool metadata, not just names.
Done when: High-risk repo workflows are tagged with clear semantics, even if only in docs at first.

39. **MCP adoption strategy** (`Soon`)
What to do: Write down which external systems would actually be worth exposing through MCP or similar integrations for moverrr.
Why it matters: The fuller Claude material shows MCP is useful when it turns real external systems into native capabilities.
Done when: There is a short list of high-value future integrations and why they matter.

40. **Permission matrix** (`Now`)
What to do: Create a simple matrix of which kinds of tasks are safe to run autonomously and which require confirmation or stronger review.
Why it matters: The Claude harness treats permission state as architecture, not UI chrome.
Done when: The repo has a documented autonomy policy for destructive, risky, or high-stakes work.

41. **Dangerous allowlist audit** (`Soon`)
What to do: Review current assumptions about broad permissions and document which ones should never become blanket defaults.
Why it matters: The detailed Claude lessons warn that broad allow rules quietly bypass safeguards.
Done when: The repo has a short written list of capability patterns that should stay gated.

42. **Shell safety policy** (`Soon`)
What to do: Write a repo-specific note on shell commands that are high-risk here, like destructive git operations or anything that bypasses checks.
Why it matters: Claude Code encodes shell caution in the runtime because it matters a lot in practice.
Done when: The repo has a shell-safety note future agents can follow without reinventing caution.

43. **Ask-user escalation policy** (`Soon`)
What to do: Define when an agent should stop and ask rather than continue autonomously.
Why it matters: Claude Code's runtime strength comes partly from knowing when to escalate.
Done when: High-risk ambiguity has a consistent escalation rule.

44. **Hook opportunity audit** (`Soon`)
What to do: List which repo behaviors are good hook candidates, such as formatting, documentation drift checks, or verification reminders.
Why it matters: The parity material shows hooks are powerful only when they actually execute real discipline.
Done when: The repo has a shortlist of hook candidates ordered by value.

45. **Hook adoption plan** (`Later`)
What to do: Decide which hook candidates are worth implementing first and which are still too annoying or premature.
Why it matters: Hooks should enforce valuable discipline, not create friction theater.
Done when: There is a staged adoption plan rather than a vague desire to "use hooks."

46. **Plugin opportunity audit** (`Later`)
What to do: Identify which plugin-like bundles would make sense for moverrr or sister projects: roles, rules, skills, and integrations packaged together.
Why it matters: Claude Code treats plugins as capability bundles, not cosmetic add-ons.
Done when: You have a shortlist of plugin-style bundles worth creating later.

47. **Structured output cleanliness check** (`Soon`)
What to do: Document what "clean structured output" means for any future machine-readable reporting or automation you add.
Why it matters: The Python port parity notes show how small output impurities break structured automation.
Done when: Future structured outputs have an explicit cleanliness standard.

48. **Repo transport surfaces list** (`Later`)
What to do: List which current or future workflows need chat-only output versus machine-readable output versus background task output.
Why it matters: The detailed analysis emphasizes that transport and rendering shape behavior.
Done when: Future automation work has a clear output-channel plan.

## E. Worktrees, Isolation, And Parallel Execution

49. **Worktree usage rules** (`Now`)
What to do: Document when future moverrr sweeps, refactors, or verification passes should happen in worktrees instead of the main checkout.
Why it matters: Claude Code uses worktrees because safe parallelism needs real isolation.
Done when: There is a written rule for when worktrees are the default safe path.

50. **Worktree naming convention** (`Now`)
What to do: Standardize worktree names for docs, product research, feature work, and verification.
Why it matters: The Claude material even validates worktree slugs because path-like identifiers can become messy or unsafe.
Done when: Worktree naming is predictable and low-risk.

51. **Selective file propagation policy** (`Soon`)
What to do: Decide which ignored local files, if any, should ever be allowed into isolated worktrees.
Why it matters: Claude Code's `.worktreeinclude` pattern exists because blanket copying is unsafe.
Done when: The repo has a narrow policy for what private or local files may be propagated.

52. **Sparse-worktree opportunity audit** (`Later`)
What to do: Decide whether future large-scope work would benefit from sparse worktrees that only load a subset of the repo.
Why it matters: The frontier harness makes isolation practical partly by making it cheaper.
Done when: You know whether sparse worktrees would help moverrr or are unnecessary right now.

53. **Parallel PR workflow** (`Soon`)
What to do: Write down how large parallel changes should be decomposed into independent units and PRs.
Why it matters: Claude Code's batch-style orchestration only works because work units are independently mergeable.
Done when: Big sweeps can be split without merge-conflict roulette.

54. **Branch lifecycle guide** (`Soon`)
What to do: Define how feature, doc, verifier, and experiment branches should be created, published, and merged.
Why it matters: Runtime discipline extends to how changes move through git.
Done when: Parallel work follows a consistent branch lifecycle.

55. **Verification-in-isolation workflow** (`Soon`)
What to do: Define when a verifier or independent reviewer should validate work from a clean or isolated branch rather than the edited tree.
Why it matters: Claude Code's verifier is powerful partly because it is not the implementer.
Done when: High-risk verification has an isolation pattern, not just a good intention.

56. **Sweep-task batching rule** (`Later`)
What to do: Define how to break large mechanical or repeated changes into small independently shippable batches.
Why it matters: Batch orchestration is one of the clearest operational lessons in the fuller harness material.
Done when: Big sweeps stop being "one giant PR" by default.

57. **Trust boundary for local reference folders** (`Now`)
What to do: Document that external or reference folders added to the repo root should not silently become trusted instruction sources.
Why it matters: Claude Code explicitly avoids auto-loading skills from unsafe or ignored places.
Done when: There is a short repo note defining trust boundaries for local archives, references, and imported materials.

58. **Scratchpad directory policy** (`Later`)
What to do: Decide where temporary notes, generated summaries, or transient artifacts should live if future workflows need them.
Why it matters: The Claude harness treats session state and scratch data as part of the environment design.
Done when: Future transient artifacts have a clean, non-chaotic home.

## F. Session Memory, Compaction, And Parity Thinking

59. **Memory layering diagram** (`Now`)
What to do: Add a small diagram or note showing how moverrr's project memory is layered today.
Why it matters: The detailed Claude analysis shows memory layering is one of the most important runtime concepts.
Done when: A human or agent can explain the repo's memory model in one glance.

60. **Local versus checked-in memory split** (`Soon`)
What to do: Clarify what belongs in checked-in project memory versus private local memory for this repo.
Why it matters: Claude Code distinguishes project and local memory because they solve different problems.
Done when: Sensitive or personal instructions stop drifting into shared repo memory.

61. **Context budget note** (`Soon`)
What to do: Add a short repo note that always-loaded docs should stay lean and that deep detail belongs in scoped rules or skills.
Why it matters: Claude Code treats context as a real budget, not an infinite pool.
Done when: Future docs do not bloat the always-loaded instruction layer casually.

62. **Compaction-ready summary template** (`Later`)
What to do: Define a standard format for summarizing long work sessions: decisions, files, verification, unresolved risk.
Why it matters: The Claude runtime keeps long sessions alive by compressing them into useful summaries.
Done when: Long-running work can be summarized without losing the important state.

63. **Session replay note for major work** (`Later`)
What to do: Decide whether important implementation or ops sessions should leave a short replayable summary artifact.
Why it matters: The Python port and Claude runtime both treat transcripts and session state as first-class assets.
Done when: Major work can be reconstructed from a concise durable summary if needed.

64. **Parity audit for repo operating system** (`Soon`)
What to do: Create a periodic audit that asks which intended roles, rules, skills, and verifiers exist versus are still missing.
Why it matters: The Python port's parity audit is a strong example of turning ambition into measurable gaps.
Done when: The repo has a measurable "operating system parity" checklist instead of vague aspirations.

65. **Project manifest for agent surfaces** (`Soon`)
What to do: Create a small markdown manifest of current rules, agents, skills, and verification surfaces.
Why it matters: The port manifest idea is useful because it makes the current surface visible.
Done when: You can inspect the current repo operating system from one summary file.

66. **Stale-reference detector** (`Soon`)
What to do: Add a recurring check for docs and skill references that point to paths, commands, or flows that no longer exist.
Why it matters: Markdown-driven systems rot when references silently die.
Done when: Broken references are surfaced regularly instead of discovered by accident.

67. **Monthly memory refactor pass** (`Now`)
What to do: Keep a recurring habit of pruning stale docs, collapsing duplicates, and moving repeated guidance into better homes.
Why it matters: Claude Code stays sharp because its instruction system is treated like product infrastructure.
Done when: Memory cleanup is a recurring task, not an emergency repair.

68. **Change-journal for operating system edits** (`Later`)
What to do: Keep a short log of major changes to the repo's agent operating system and why they were made.
Why it matters: Once the markdown layer becomes important, its evolution deserves traceability.
Done when: Major operating-system changes are no longer only visible through git archaeology.

## G. Verification, QA, And Runtime Reliability

69. **Booking concurrency integration test** (`Now`)
What to do: Add a real integration test that proves only one booking can win the race on the same listing.
Why it matters: The strongest Claude verifier lesson is to attack the unhappy path directly.
Done when: Concurrent booking attempts demonstrably cannot oversell capacity.

70. **Dispute-completion regression test** (`Now`)
What to do: Add a test proving unresolved disputes cannot transition to completed.
Why it matters: This is one of moverrr's core business guards and should never depend on memory alone.
Done when: The guard fails loudly if it regresses.

71. **Webhook replay harness** (`Now`)
What to do: Build a replay path for payment-webhook sequences so failures can be debugged intentionally.
Why it matters: High-stakes flows need reproducible verification, not anecdotal investigation.
Done when: A broken payment sequence can be replayed locally from a known fixture or script.

72. **Route-contract smoke suite** (`Soon`)
What to do: Add a fast suite that checks response shape and auth expectations for core public, carrier, customer, and admin routes.
Why it matters: The parity and harness material show the value of broad surface visibility, not only deep unit tests.
Done when: Core route drift is caught quickly by one standard smoke pass.

73. **Mobile proof-upload harness** (`Soon`)
What to do: Add a focused verification harness for proof upload flows, including HEIC acceptance and camera-first behavior.
Why it matters: moverrr's mobile proof path is part of trust, not just UI.
Done when: Proof upload regressions are testable and obvious.

74. **Verifier report template** (`Now`)
What to do: Standardize how future verification reports should present checks run, evidence observed, pass/fail result, and residual risk.
Why it matters: Claude Code's verifier is strong because its output is structured and evidence-led.
Done when: Verification reports across the repo become comparable and easy to trust.

75. **Adversarial probe checklist** (`Now`)
What to do: Define a short list of adversarial probes future verifiers should consider: concurrency, boundary values, duplicate actions, stale states, narrow viewport, or missing config.
Why it matters: The verification agent's biggest lesson is "try to break it."
Done when: Every serious verification pass includes at least one adversarial probe.

76. **Bug reproduction template** (`Soon`)
What to do: Create a one-page bug template that captures steps, expected behavior, actual behavior, impacted user, and verification path.
Why it matters: Reliable bug work begins with reproducibility, not just issue labels.
Done when: New bugfix work starts from a reproducible template.

## H. Experiment Loops, Review Rituals, And Ongoing Projects

77. **Experiment ledger** (`Now`)
What to do: Create one place to record experiment baseline, hypothesis, change, result, and keep/discard decision.
Why it matters: This is the most transferable `autoresearch` lesson.
Done when: Meaningful experiments stop disappearing into memory or chat history.

78. **Baseline template** (`Now`)
What to do: Require every experiment or optimization task to state the current baseline before work begins.
Why it matters: Without a baseline, improvement claims are mostly storytelling.
Done when: Future experiment ideas begin with a real number or clear current-state description.

79. **Keep/discard threshold rule** (`Now`)
What to do: Require every experiment to name the outcome that means keep and the outcome that means discard or reframe.
Why it matters: `autoresearch` is powerful because it advances only when the result is better.
Done when: Experiments have an explicit decision rule before they start.

80. **Near-miss review loop** (`Soon`)
What to do: Create a periodic review for experiments that almost worked but were inconclusive.
Why it matters: Frontier loops improve faster when they revisit promising near-misses deliberately.
Done when: Near-miss experiments get a structured revisit decision instead of being forgotten.

81. **Simplification win log** (`Soon`)
What to do: Track cases where deleting or simplifying something kept or improved outcomes.
Why it matters: `autoresearch` treats simplification as a real win, and moverrr should too.
Done when: The repo has a visible record of "complexity removed" wins.

82. **Weekly operating review** (`Soon`)
What to do: Run one weekly review across instruction quality, verification debt, broken trust flows, and experiment outcomes.
Why it matters: Claude Code's runtime discipline is powerful because maintenance is continuous, not occasional.
Done when: There is a repeatable weekly review ritual with a written format.

83. **Cross-project operating-system template** (`Later`)
What to do: Distill the best moverrr instruction, role, and verification patterns into a reusable template for future projects.
Why it matters: The user explicitly wants learnings that can help ongoing projects, not only this repo.
Done when: There is a starter operating-system template that future repos can copy and adapt.

84. **Monthly frontier review** (`Later`)
What to do: Once a month, review new frontier harness learnings, new Claude/Codex workflows, and recent moverrr pain points to see what deserves adoption.
Why it matters: The frontier moves quickly, but not every new idea belongs in the repo right away.
Done when: There is a recurring founder-level review that converts outside learning into selective internal adoption.


# Airtasker + Airbnb Learning For moverrr

Last revised: 1 April 2026 (Sydney)

## What This Document Is

This is not a source dump.
This is a founder action brief for moverrr.

It takes useful patterns from Airtasker, Airbnb, marketplace ops playbooks, payment infrastructure docs, and Australia-specific trust/compliance guidance, then rewrites them into tasks that fit moverrr's actual shape:

- browse-first
- spare-capacity inventory
- awkward-middle Sydney moves
- mobile-first
- manual-first operations where that buys speed

## Product Truth We Must Protect

Before any task gets built, ask:

1. Does this help carriers post real spare capacity faster?
2. Does this make browse and booking clearer for customers?
3. Does this reduce founder ops pain without creating product bloat?
4. Does this keep moverrr out of quote-engine, bidding, dispatch, and removalist territory?
5. Is the smallest useful version obvious?

If the answer is no, do not build it yet.

## How To Use This File

Every task below follows one format:

- `What to do`: the smallest useful implementation
- `Why it matters`: the product reason
- `Done when`: the practical finish line

Priority labels:

- `Now`: should improve trust, clarity, supply, or ops in the next round
- `Soon`: valuable once the core loop is reliable
- `Later`: useful after the marketplace has more volume

## The Big Founder Moves

These are the main lessons worth stealing from Airtasker and Airbnb, translated for moverrr:

1. Great marketplaces explain the job before they explain the feature.
2. Trust comes from visible evidence, not brand claims.
3. Listing quality is a product system, not just user effort.
4. Messaging should reduce uncertainty, not create a shadow workflow.
5. Payments should feel safe, predictable, and boring.

## 100 Actionable Tasks

## A. Search, Browse, And First Impression

1. **Search card: why this trip fits** (`Now`)
What to do: Add a dedicated line on each result card that explains the fit in plain English: route, timing, spare capacity, and why the price is lower.
Why it matters: Airbnb and Airtasker both reduce uncertainty fast; moverrr needs to make the spare-capacity story legible before the tap.
Done when: Every trip card answers "why am I seeing this?" in one screenful.

2. **Search card: total price, not teaser price** (`Now`)
What to do: Show the full customer price on the result card, with a smaller breakdown available on tap.
Why it matters: Hidden-fee anxiety kills trust early.
Done when: A customer can compare two trips without opening either one to understand the likely total.

3. **Search card: timing certainty badge** (`Now`)
What to do: Add chips like `fixed pickup window`, `flexible dropoff`, `same-day route`, or `weekend run`.
Why it matters: Time confidence is one of the biggest filters in moving.
Done when: Timing confidence is visible without reading long descriptions.

4. **Search card: capacity made human** (`Now`)
What to do: Translate capacity into examples like `fits 1 fridge`, `fits 1 mattress`, `fits 8 boxes`, alongside any raw capacity metric.
Why it matters: Most customers do not think in percentages or cubic metres.
Done when: Search cards help users self-qualify without guessing.

5. **Search filters: item-shaped, not logistics-shaped** (`Now`)
What to do: Add filters like `single furniture`, `appliance`, `marketplace pickup`, `small business overflow`, `student move`.
Why it matters: moverrr should feel like browseable inventory for specific problems, not freight software.
Done when: The top filters match real customer language.

6. **Search filters: access constraints** (`Now`)
What to do: Add filters for stairs, lift, narrow access, loading dock, parking difficulty, and helper needed.
Why it matters: Accessibility and handling complexity are part of fit, not edge cases.
Done when: Customers can eliminate obviously wrong trips before checkout.

7. **Search results: route corridor shelf** (`Soon`)
What to do: Add featured shelves for common corridors like `Inner West`, `Eastern Suburbs pickups`, `Parramatta -> City`, `Sydney marketplace pickups`.
Why it matters: Airbnb uses curation to make supply feel real; moverrr can do the same with route corridors.
Done when: Browse has reusable shelves that make inventory density feel stronger.

8. **Search results: map plus list** (`Soon`)
What to do: Add a suburb-safe map view that shows route corridors, not exact addresses.
Why it matters: Maps create confidence, but privacy still matters.
Done when: A user can browse by geography without revealing private locations.

9. **Search ranking: support-risk aware ordering** (`Soon`)
What to do: Blend trust, completeness, response rate, proof quality, and route fit into ranking instead of using only relevance or price.
Why it matters: Airbnb's more mature systems optimize for lower support burden as well as conversion; moverrr should learn that early.
Done when: Weak, risky, incomplete listings stop floating to the top.

10. **Search ranking: hide weak inventory by default** (`Now`)
What to do: Downrank listings missing photos, rules, vehicle info, or reliable timing unless the user explicitly filters broadly.

12. **Empty state: show nearby alternatives** (`Now`)
What to do: Suggest nearby suburbs, adjacent dates, and flexible timing options.
Why it matters: Customers often need help reframing the request, not leaving the product.
Done when: No-result pages always offer three next actions.

13. **Saved search digest** (`Soon`)
What to do: Send a route alert when matching or near-matching capacity appears.
Why it matters: Airbnb wishlists and saved browsing patterns create return loops; moverrr needs route alerts for low-density inventory.
Done when: Saved search users receive useful, low-noise reactivation messages.

14. **Browse card: trust stack preview** (`Now`)
What to do: Show a compact trust row: verified identity, proof history, response speed, completed jobs, and review score.
Why it matters: Trust must be legible before a user commits attention.
Done when: Cards display trust signals without needing a long profile visit.

15. **Browse card: route story headline** (`Later`)
What to do: Generate a short route headline like `Already driving Surry Hills -> Newtown after marketplace pickups`.

## First 15 To Actually Build

If we want the strongest next move, build these first:

1. Search card: why this trip fits
2. Search card: total price, not teaser price
3. Empty state: save this route
4. Hero section: real trip first
5. Pricing panel: full moverrr breakdown
6. Trip detail: included vs not included
7. Posting flow: duplicate last trip
8. Posting flow: publish gate for weak listings
9. Carrier profile: layered badges
10. Off-platform leak prevention
11. Thread header tied to booking status
12. Automated nudges for missing next steps
13. Booking breakdown consistency
14. Pickup proof pack

## What Not To Build By Accident

Do not let these tasks drift into:

- quote requests from customers to many carriers
- bidding wars
- hidden ranking logic that cannot be explained
- live dispatch and route optimization
- bespoke removalist service packages
- unlimited message-based price negotiation
- complicated enterprise compliance theater

## Research Basis

This document was informed by patterns repeatedly visible across:

- Airtasker trust, contact privacy, badges, payment release, payout, and communication rules
- Airbnb listing clarity, total-price visibility, response expectations, pending states, reviews, accessibility thinking, and host operations patterns
- marketplace operations playbooks for payments, messaging, and notifications
- Australia-specific privacy, consumer, safety, and reporting guidance

The important move was not to copy those products literally.
The important move was to translate what makes them legible, trustworthy, and operationally resilient into moverrr's much narrower spare-capacity marketplace.
