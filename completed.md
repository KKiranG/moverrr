## 2026-04-01 — Production Safety, Booking Integrity, and MVP UX Hardening

### `COMP-2026-04-01-11` — Carrier templates, quick post, and route re-posting
- Moved from active backlog: 15-hour session Group 1
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `supabase/migrations/009_trip_templates.sql`
  - `src/lib/data/templates.ts`
  - `src/app/api/trips/templates/*`
  - `src/components/carrier/quick-post-templates.tsx`
  - `src/components/carrier/save-trip-template-action.tsx`
  - `src/components/carrier/carrier-post-prefill.tsx`
  - `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/trips/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `src/components/carrier/carrier-trip-wizard.tsx`
- Why:
  - Repeated corridor posting is the highest-leverage carrier retention loop in the MVP.
  - Expired or cancelled routes also needed a faster “try this again” path than re-entering the full wizard from scratch.
- What changed:
  - Added a private `trip_templates` table with RLS, spatial indexes, and typed DB access.
  - Added template list/create/delete/post APIs plus server data helpers for creating templates from live trips and creating new trips from templates.
  - Added “Save as template” on carrier trip detail and a dashboard “Quick Post” surface that lets carriers confirm only date, time window, and price.
  - Added query-param powered route re-posting for expired/cancelled trips and taught the carrier wizard to hydrate real route defaults.
  - Added onboarding progress gating so carriers see what is missing before verification submission.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-12` — Realtime carrier bookings, Upstash rate limiting, and finalized atomic booking migration
- Moved from active backlog: 15-hour session Group 2
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `supabase/migrations/008_atomic_booking_function.sql`
  - `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`
  - `src/lib/rate-limit.ts`
  - `src/app/api/upload/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/search/route.ts`
  - `src/components/carrier/live-bookings-list.tsx`
  - `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Why:
  - Booking integrity, live operational visibility, and durable rate limiting are all part of the trust layer for a marketplace handling real inventory and payments.
- What changed:
  - Finalized and tracked the atomic booking RPC migration, including service availability guards inside the function.
  - Kept booking creation on the RPC path in application code and preserved explicit error mapping for full/closed listings.
  - Replaced in-memory-only rate limiting with Upstash-backed sliding windows while keeping the intentional in-memory fallback when Redis env vars are absent.
  - Added a live carrier bookings section that subscribes to Supabase Realtime and refreshes the booking list automatically.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`
  - `npm run supabase:db:push` attempted, but local Supabase was not linked (`supabase link` not configured in this workspace).

### `COMP-2026-04-01-13` — Saved searches, customer stepper clarity, and camera-first proof capture
- Moved from active backlog: 15-hour session Group 3
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `supabase/migrations/010_saved_searches.sql`
  - `src/lib/data/saved-searches.ts`
  - `src/app/api/saved-searches/*`
  - `src/components/search/save-search-form.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/search/page.tsx`
  - `supabase/functions/notify-saved-searches/index.ts`
  - `src/components/booking/booking-status-stepper.tsx`
  - `src/components/booking/status-update-actions.tsx`
  - `src/components/booking/dispute-form.tsx`
- Why:
  - Empty search results need a retention path instead of a dead end.
  - Booking state clarity and mobile-first proof capture are direct trust multipliers for both sides of the marketplace.
- What changed:
  - Added the `saved_searches` table with RLS, typed access, CRUD APIs, and a Deno edge-function skeleton for route-alert notifications.
  - Replaced the empty-search waitlist copy with a logged-in saved-search flow and a sign-in CTA for anonymous users.
  - Reworked the booking detail status UI into a clearer vertical stepper.
  - Made pickup, delivery, and dispute proof capture camera-primary on mobile with HEIC/HEIF support preserved.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-14` — Admin analytics cards and in-page document preview
- Moved from active backlog: 15-hour session Group 4
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/lib/data/admin.ts`
  - `src/types/admin.ts`
  - `src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(admin)/admin/verification/page.tsx`
  - `src/components/admin/verification-queue.tsx`
  - `src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`
- Why:
  - The early ops team needs a fast dashboard for core marketplace health and a verification queue that does not require bouncing to raw document URLs.
- What changed:
  - Expanded admin metrics to include search-to-booking conversion, fill-rate target progress, average job value, and dispute rate.
  - Added last-updated display and richer card formatting on the admin dashboard.
  - Turned the verification page into a real review queue and added Radix-based document preview modals for licence and insurance images.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-15` — Error boundaries, skeleton states, SEO metadata, and accessibility sweep
- Moved from active backlog: 15-hour session Group 5
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/components/shared/error-boundary.tsx`
  - `src/components/search/search-results-skeleton.tsx`
  - `src/components/carrier/trip-list-skeleton.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/search/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/bookings/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/trip/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/layout.tsx`
  - multiple pages and forms under `src/app/` and `src/components/`
- Why:
  - The MVP still needs resilient sections, non-blank loading states, better sharing metadata, and baseline WCAG hygiene before more feature depth is added.
- What changed:
  - Added reusable client error boundaries and Suspense fallbacks on major search, carrier dashboard, and bookings sections.
  - Added search and carrier list skeletons so loading does not collapse into empty white space.
  - Added dynamic trip metadata for richer social previews.
  - Added a global skip link, explicit `main-content` targets, more form labels, and extra mobile-friendly camera/upload affordances in customer forms.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-01` — Atomic booking creation and conflict-safe capacity handling
- Moved from active backlog: original `A4` and `A12`
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `supabase/migrations/008_atomic_booking_function.sql`
  - `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`
  - `src/types/database.ts`
- Why:
  - Booking creation previously used a read-then-write flow, which left the app exposed to oversell when two customers booked the same listing at nearly the same time.
  - The frontend also needed a reliable way to distinguish “listing is full” from a generic 500.
- What changed:
  - Added a new `create_booking_atomic` Postgres function that locks the listing row, recalculates pricing inside the transaction, inserts the booking, writes the initial booking event, and updates listing capacity/status before releasing the lock.
  - Switched `createBookingForCustomer` to call the RPC instead of directly inserting into `bookings`.
  - Added typed RPC args in `src/types/database.ts`.
  - Mapped `listing_not_bookable` to an application-level `409` conflict so the UI can handle a full listing as a product state instead of a server failure.
  - Added a cancellation-side capacity/status recalculation path so cancelled bookings do not leave the listing in the wrong availability state.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-02` — API hardening for uploads and cross-origin POST requests
- Moved from active backlog: `A2`, `A3`, `A8`
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/app/api/upload/route.ts`
  - `middleware.ts`
- Why:
  - File uploads accepted too much trust from the client and lacked a hard content-length guard.
  - Booking and payment POST routes lacked origin validation.
- What changed:
  - Added a 10MB pre-parse upload limit based on `Content-Length`.
  - Added explicit MIME allowlisting for images plus `image/heic`, `image/heif`, and PDF uploads.
  - Added CSRF-style origin checks for mutating `/api/bookings/*` and `/api/payments/*` routes, while keeping `/api/payments/webhook` exempt.
  - Expanded middleware matchers so API routes are actually protected by the new logic.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-03` — Trip date validation, text sanitization, and production env enforcement
- Moved from active backlog: `A1`, `A6`, `A7`, `A11`
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/lib/validation/trip.ts`
  - `src/lib/validation/booking.ts`
  - `src/lib/utils.ts`
  - `src/app/api/trips/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts`
  - `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Why:
  - Carriers could submit past-dated trips.
  - Booking and trip free text needed normalization before persistence.
  - Production env validation existed but was not actually enforced at runtime.
- What changed:
  - Added reusable date refinement so both `tripSchema` and `tripUpdateSchema` reject past dates.
  - Added `sanitizeText()` and applied it to booking text fields plus trip create/update API payloads.
  - Wired `assertRequiredEnv()` into the root server layout so missing production env vars fail fast rather than surfacing as broken runtime behavior later.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-04` — Proper customer-facing not-found flows for trips and bookings
- Moved from active backlog: `A9`, `A10`
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/app/(customer)/trip/[id]/not-found.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/bookings/[id]/not-found.tsx`
- Why:
  - Missing or unauthorized resources should resolve to a deliberate recovery path, not an empty or confusing page state.
- What changed:
  - Added dedicated not-found pages for trip detail and booking detail.
  - Preserved the existing `notFound()` calls in the route pages and gave them helpful recovery links back to `/search` and `/bookings`.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-05` — Booking flow clarity: retryable payment setup, stepper, and form counters
- Moved from active backlog: `B4`, `B7`, `B11`
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/components/booking/booking-form.tsx`
  - `src/components/booking/booking-status-stepper.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/bookings/[id]/page.tsx`
- Why:
  - Payment setup failures were generic and easy to misunderstand.
  - Booking detail status needed a clearer progress UI.
  - Booking form text input lacked feedback on limits.
- What changed:
  - Added clearer payment setup messaging and a retry path when booking creation succeeds but payment-intent creation fails.
  - Added a dedicated booking status stepper and replaced the old text-only list in booking detail.
  - Made item description controlled and added a live `n/200` counter.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-06` — Carrier onboarding and admin action feedback
- Moved from active backlog: `B5`, `B6`, `B12`, `B18`
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/components/carrier/carrier-onboarding-form.tsx`
  - `src/components/admin/verify-carrier-actions.tsx`
  - `src/components/carrier/carrier-trip-wizard.tsx`
  - `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/trips/page.tsx`
- Why:
  - Uploading docs felt opaque.
  - Admin verification actions needed clear async feedback.
  - Carrier special notes needed limit visibility.
  - After trip posting, there was no obvious path back to the dashboard.
- What changed:
  - Added onboarding document progress UI, upload percent feedback, and green checkmarks for successful uploads.
  - Added spinners to approve/reject actions.
  - Added live `n/280` counter for carrier trip special notes.
  - Added a success banner on the carrier trips page with a direct “Go to dashboard” action after posting.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-07` — iOS-first interaction and touch polish
- Moved from active backlog: `C1`, `C2`, `C3`, `C7`, `C8`
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/components/carrier/carrier-trip-wizard.tsx`
  - `src/components/booking/status-update-actions.tsx`
  - `src/components/booking/dispute-form.tsx`
  - `src/app/globals.css`
  - `src/components/layout/site-header.tsx`
  - `src/components/ui/button.tsx`
- Why:
  - The product is intended to be iPhone-first, so hover-only feedback and undersized tap experiences are bugs, not polish.
- What changed:
  - Replaced carrier wizard checkbox inputs with custom button-style toggles and hidden inputs.
  - Added `capture="environment"` and explicit HEIC/HEIF support to proof-photo flows.
  - Added safe-area variables, overscroll containment, and global `focus-visible` styling.
  - Added `active:` states to header links and core button variants.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-08` — Browse/search clarity improvements
- Moved from active backlog: `B1`, `B2`, `B13`, `B14`
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/app/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/search/page.tsx`
  - `src/components/customer/waitlist-form.tsx`
  - `src/components/trip/trip-card.tsx`
- Why:
  - MVP value proposition needs to land immediately on 375px mobile screens.
  - Empty search states should convert uncertainty into a concrete next step.
  - Trust signals should exist at browse-time, not only inside the trip detail page.
- What changed:
  - Moved the landing-page value explanation above the search form.
  - Reframed the search empty state around “Get notified” and updated the CTA copy.
  - Added carrier rating/review count on trip cards.
  - Switched the browse-stage verified badge to an explicit green trust signal.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-09` — Search date defaults no longer go stale
- Discovered during implementation pass, not originally listed
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/lib/utils.ts`
  - `src/components/search/search-bar.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/search/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/page.tsx`
- Why:
  - The app was still seeded with a hardcoded March 2026 date. As time moved forward, search defaults and sample links would silently feel broken.
- What changed:
  - Added `getTodayIsoDate()` and used it for the search form default date, search-page fallback date, and landing-page sample search link.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-10` — Workspace typecheck now targets the product, not the reference folders
- Discovered during verification, not originally listed
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `tsconfig.json`
- Why:
  - `tsc --noEmit` was walking reference folders such as `other best projects- only for ideas/`, which produced thousands of irrelevant type errors unrelated to moverrr.
- What changed:
  - Narrowed the TypeScript include/exclude rules so checks run against the actual app workspace plus Next-generated types.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-11` — Search accessibility, pending-booking clarity, and live verification/dashboard surfaces
- Moved from active backlog: `BUG-01`, `BUG-08`, `BUG-16`, `BUG-18`, `BUG-21`
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/components/shared/google-autocomplete-input.tsx`
  - `src/components/booking/pending-expiry-countdown.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/bookings/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `src/components/admin/verification-queue.tsx`
  - `src/app/(admin)/admin/verification/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(admin)/admin/carriers/page.tsx`
  - `src/components/admin/verify-carrier-actions.tsx`
  - `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Why:
  - Address selection relied on Google’s default widget, which did not expose reliable keyboard selection or ARIA relationships.
  - Pending bookings did not explain the 2-hour carrier response window clearly enough.
  - The admin verification screen was still a checklist placeholder even though carrier review data already existed.
  - Carrier dashboard summary cards still showed placeholder math instead of operationally trustworthy numbers.
- What changed:
  - Replaced the Google Places widget wrapper with a custom combobox-style autocomplete that supports `ArrowUp`, `ArrowDown`, `Enter`, `Escape`, `role="listbox"`, `role="option"`, and `aria-activedescendant`.
  - Added a live pending-booking expiry card that counts down from `created_at + 2h` and switches to an auto-expiry message once the window has elapsed.
  - Replaced the admin verification checklist shell with a live carrier queue, including real document/service-area context and lightweight review notes persisted in `localStorage`.
  - Extended verification actions so review notes flow through to the API and DB-backed carrier notes when approve/reject is used.
  - Replaced placeholder carrier dashboard cards with real listing/booking-derived counts and payout math, and surfaced per-trip status plus remaining capacity in the list.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-12` — Payment lifecycle semantics, structured webhook context, and proportional capacity recovery
- Moved from active backlog: `BUG-09`, `BUG-10`, `BUG-11`, `BUG-12`, `BUG-17`, `BUG-23`, `BUG-25`
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `config/required-production-env.json`
  - `next.config.js`
  - `src/lib/env.ts`
  - `src/lib/utils.ts`
  - `src/app/api/bookings/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts`
  - `src/lib/booking-capacity.ts`
  - `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`
  - `src/lib/data/admin.ts`
  - `src/components/admin/resolve-dispute-actions.tsx`
  - `supabase/migrations/010_capacity_recalculation.sql`
- Why:
  - Production env validation still happened too late in the runtime path.
  - Free-text sanitization still allowed pasted HTML tags through.
  - Booking conflict responses were not consistently serialized for frontend handling.
  - Payment status transitions blurred “intent created” and “authorization confirmed.”
  - Webhook incident review still lacked explicit operator-facing log context.
  - Booking cancellation recovery still depended on a flat 25% capacity heuristic.
- What changed:
  - Added a shared required-env manifest and enforced it from `next.config.js` so production builds fail before deployment when critical env vars are missing.
  - Upgraded `sanitizeText()` to strip HTML tags before normalizing whitespace.
  - Updated `/api/bookings` to return `{ error, code }` payloads, including the `409` `listing_not_bookable` case.
  - Changed payment-intent creation to record the Stripe intent ID without prematurely marking the booking as `authorized`, and renamed the booking event to `payment_intent_created`.
  - Tightened webhook updates so `payment_intent.amount_capturable_updated` marks bookings `authorized`, `payment_intent.succeeded` marks them `captured`, and failure/missing-row paths emit structured console context alongside Sentry capture.
  - Added visible loading ownership to admin dispute actions and routed dispute-driven booking status changes back through the shared booking transition helper.
  - Replaced flat 25% capacity math with dimension/weight/category-based capacity estimation in both the app layer and the booking RPC, and recalculated listing capacity from active bookings instead of incrementing/decrementing blindly.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-13` — Local-date handling and demo data now roll forward automatically
- Discovered during backlog pass; this advances but does not fully close `BUG-20`
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/lib/utils.ts`
  - `src/lib/demo-data.ts`
- Why:
  - `toISOString()`-based date defaults can drift relative to the user’s local day, and demo inventory should not silently age into the past.
- What changed:
  - Updated `getTodayIsoDate()` to derive the local calendar date instead of the raw UTC date.
  - Switched demo trip dates to relative future dates so sample inventory remains current without hand-editing constants.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

## Already Present In Repo Before This Pass

> These capabilities were already implemented in the workspace before the 2026-04-01 Codex pass. Exact ship dates are not recoverable from the current workspace alone, so they are recorded as “pre-2026-04-01”.

### `BASELINE-01` — Browse-first marketplace shell
- When: pre-`2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/app/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/search/page.tsx`
  - `src/components/trip/`
- What was already done:
  - Landing page, public search, and trip-card browse surfaces existed and were wired into the browse-first spare-capacity model.
- Why it matters:
  - This is the core product wedge: inventory-first discovery rather than quote-first demand collection.

### `BASELINE-02` — Carrier onboarding, trip posting, and trip editing
- When: pre-`2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/onboarding/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/post/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/trips/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `src/components/carrier/`
- What was already done:
  - Carriers could onboard, upload documents, post trips, and edit live listings.
- Why it matters:
  - Supply creation is the MVP bottleneck; this baseline already gave moverrr a usable carrier-side core.

### `BASELINE-03` — Customer booking lifecycle pages
- When: pre-`2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/app/(customer)/trip/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/bookings/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/bookings/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `src/components/booking/`
- What was already done:
  - Booking creation, booking detail, review submission, dispute intake, and proof-backed status management were already represented in the app.
- Why it matters:
  - This meant the product already had an end-to-end customer journey before today’s hardening work.

### `BASELINE-04` — Admin operations surfaces
- When: pre-`2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/app/(admin)/admin/*`
  - `src/components/admin/*`
  - `src/lib/data/admin.ts`
- What was already done:
  - Admin dashboards, carrier review helpers, dispute resolution flows, and bootstrap tooling already existed in the repo.
- Why it matters:
  - Even as an MVP, moverrr already had the beginnings of an operations layer rather than being customer/carrier only.

### `BASELINE-05` — Notifications and webhook safety checks already existed
- When: pre-`2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/lib/notifications.ts`
  - `src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts`
- What was already done:
  - Email send failures were already being captured to Sentry.
  - Stripe webhook updates already checked for missing booking rows rather than assuming the update succeeded.
- Why it matters:
  - These were two important safety items from the guide that did not need reimplementation.

### `BASELINE-06` — Core data model, matching RPC, and typed Supabase integration
- When: pre-`2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `supabase/migrations/001` through `007`
  - `src/lib/data/*`
  - `src/types/database.ts`
- What was already done:
  - PostGIS, core marketplace tables, matching RPCs, RLS policies, indexes, and typed database access were already in place.
- Why it matters:
  - The product already had a real backend shape suitable for continuing toward an MVP, rather than a frontend-only shell.
