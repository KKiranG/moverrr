## 2026-04-01 — Production Safety, Booking Integrity, and MVP UX Hardening

### `COMP-2026-04-01-11` — Carrier templates, quick post, and route re-posting
- Moved from active backlog: 15-hour session Group 1
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `supabase/migrations/009_trip_templates.sql`
  - `src/lib/data/templates.ts`
  - `src/app/api/trips/templates/*`
  - `src/components/carrier/quick-post-templates.tsx`
  - `src/components/carrier/save-trip-template-action.tsx`
  - `src/components/carrier/carrier-post-prefill.tsx`
  - `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/trips/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `src/components/carrier/carrier-trip-wizard.tsx`
- Why:
  - Repeated corridor posting is the highest-leverage carrier retention loop in the MVP.
  - Expired or cancelled routes also needed a faster “try this again” path than re-entering the full wizard from scratch.
- What changed:
  - Added a private `trip_templates` table with RLS, spatial indexes, and typed DB access.
  - Added template list/create/delete/post APIs plus server data helpers for creating templates from live trips and creating new trips from templates.
  - Added “Save as template” on carrier trip detail and a dashboard “Quick Post” surface that lets carriers confirm only date, time window, and price.
  - Added query-param powered route re-posting for expired/cancelled trips and taught the carrier wizard to hydrate real route defaults.
  - Added onboarding progress gating so carriers see what is missing before verification submission.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-12` — Realtime carrier bookings, Upstash rate limiting, and finalized atomic booking migration
- Moved from active backlog: 15-hour session Group 2
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `supabase/migrations/008_atomic_booking_function.sql`
  - `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`
  - `src/lib/rate-limit.ts`
  - `src/app/api/upload/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/search/route.ts`
  - `src/components/carrier/live-bookings-list.tsx`
  - `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Why:
  - Booking integrity, live operational visibility, and durable rate limiting are all part of the trust layer for a marketplace handling real inventory and payments.
- What changed:
  - Finalized and tracked the atomic booking RPC migration, including service availability guards inside the function.
  - Kept booking creation on the RPC path in application code and preserved explicit error mapping for full/closed listings.
  - Replaced in-memory-only rate limiting with Upstash-backed sliding windows while keeping the intentional in-memory fallback when Redis env vars are absent.
  - Added a live carrier bookings section that subscribes to Supabase Realtime and refreshes the booking list automatically.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`
  - `npm run supabase:db:push` attempted, but local Supabase was not linked (`supabase link` not configured in this workspace).

### `COMP-2026-04-01-13` — Saved searches, customer stepper clarity, and camera-first proof capture
- Moved from active backlog: 15-hour session Group 3
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `supabase/migrations/010_saved_searches.sql`
  - `src/lib/data/saved-searches.ts`
  - `src/app/api/saved-searches/*`
  - `src/components/search/save-search-form.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/search/page.tsx`
  - `supabase/functions/notify-saved-searches/index.ts`
  - `src/components/booking/booking-status-stepper.tsx`
  - `src/components/booking/status-update-actions.tsx`
  - `src/components/booking/dispute-form.tsx`
- Why:
  - Empty search results need a retention path instead of a dead end.
  - Booking state clarity and mobile-first proof capture are direct trust multipliers for both sides of the marketplace.
- What changed:
  - Added the `saved_searches` table with RLS, typed access, CRUD APIs, and a Deno edge-function skeleton for route-alert notifications.
  - Replaced the empty-search waitlist copy with a logged-in saved-search flow and a sign-in CTA for anonymous users.
  - Reworked the booking detail status UI into a clearer vertical stepper.
  - Made pickup, delivery, and dispute proof capture camera-primary on mobile with HEIC/HEIF support preserved.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-14` — Admin analytics cards and in-page document preview
- Moved from active backlog: 15-hour session Group 4
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/lib/data/admin.ts`
  - `src/types/admin.ts`
  - `src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(admin)/admin/verification/page.tsx`
  - `src/components/admin/verification-queue.tsx`
  - `src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`
- Why:
  - The early ops team needs a fast dashboard for core marketplace health and a verification queue that does not require bouncing to raw document URLs.
- What changed:
  - Expanded admin metrics to include search-to-booking conversion, fill-rate target progress, average job value, and dispute rate.
  - Added last-updated display and richer card formatting on the admin dashboard.
  - Turned the verification page into a real review queue and added Radix-based document preview modals for licence and insurance images.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-15` — Error boundaries, skeleton states, SEO metadata, and accessibility sweep
- Moved from active backlog: 15-hour session Group 5
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/components/shared/error-boundary.tsx`
  - `src/components/search/search-results-skeleton.tsx`
  - `src/components/carrier/trip-list-skeleton.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/search/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/bookings/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/trip/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/layout.tsx`
  - multiple pages and forms under `src/app/` and `src/components/`
- Why:
  - The MVP still needs resilient sections, non-blank loading states, better sharing metadata, and baseline WCAG hygiene before more feature depth is added.
- What changed:
  - Added reusable client error boundaries and Suspense fallbacks on major search, carrier dashboard, and bookings sections.
  - Added search and carrier list skeletons so loading does not collapse into empty white space.
  - Added dynamic trip metadata for richer social previews.
  - Added a global skip link, explicit `main-content` targets, more form labels, and extra mobile-friendly camera/upload affordances in customer forms.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-16` — Carrier dashboard signals, publish scheduling, and template operations
- **When:** 2026-04-01
- **By:** Codex
- **Files changed:** `supabase/migrations/013_p3_enhancements.sql`, `src/lib/validation/trip.ts`, `src/lib/data/trips.ts`, `src/lib/data/templates.ts`, `src/types/database.ts`, `src/types/trip.ts`, `src/types/carrier.ts`, `src/lib/data/mappers.ts`, `src/components/carrier/live-bookings-list.tsx`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/dashboard/page.tsx`, `src/components/carrier/carrier-trip-wizard.tsx`, `src/components/carrier/carrier-post-prefill.tsx`, `src/components/carrier/trip-edit-form.tsx`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/trips/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/app/api/trips/templates/[id]/route.ts`, `src/components/booking/carrier-review-response-form.tsx`, `src/app/api/reviews/[id]/response/route.ts`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/templates/page.tsx`, `src/components/carrier/template-library.tsx`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/payouts/page.tsx`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/stats/page.tsx`
- **Why it mattered:** Carriers need faster operational visibility and lower-friction reposting so spare-capacity supply turns into repeat supply instead of one-off posts.
- **What was done:**
  - Added realtime booking badges, live status counts, and a chronological activity feed on the carrier dashboard.
  - Added optional trip `publish_at` scheduling in schema, validation, trip creation, and trip editing so listings can go live later instead of immediately.
  - Reworked expired/cancelled reposting into an explicit “Post similar trip” path and created a carrier-side review-response flow that also surfaces on the public carrier profile.
  - Added a full templates page with rename/archive/delete/duplicate actions, recurring route suggestions, and analytics powered by real template-linked listing and booking joins.
  - Added dedicated carrier payouts and performance pages to expose pending earnings, released/refunded history, acceptance/completion rates, and repeat-route insights.
- **Verification:** `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-17` — Customer saved-search management and richer trust emails
- **When:** 2026-04-01
- **By:** Codex
- **Files changed:** `src/lib/data/saved-searches.ts`, `src/app/api/saved-searches/route.ts`, `src/app/api/saved-searches/[id]/route.ts`, `src/components/search/saved-searches-manager.tsx`, `src/app/(customer)/saved-searches/page.tsx`, `src/components/layout/site-header.tsx`, `supabase/functions/notify-saved-searches/index.ts`, `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`
- **Why it mattered:** Saved-search retention and first-booking trust both depend on customers getting clear, editable alerts and professional confirmation artifacts right after action.
- **What was done:**
  - Added a customer “Saved searches” management screen with edit, pause/resume, and delete actions backed by new PATCH support in the saved-search API.
  - Promoted saved-search access into the main navigation so the alert flow is manageable instead of fire-and-forget.
  - Replaced the saved-search alert email with a richer HTML layout and direct booking CTA.
  - Upgraded booking-created emails into structured HTML confirmations with route, carrier, total paid, booking reference, and preparation checklist details.
- **Verification:** `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-18` — Platform health, CI, release tagging, and contributor workflow docs
- **When:** 2026-04-01
- **By:** Codex
- **Files changed:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.env.example`, `package.json`, `next.config.js`, `src/lib/sentry.ts`, `src/lib/rate-limit.ts`, `src/app/api/admin/rate-limit/route.ts`, `src/app/api/health/route.ts`, `supabase/README.md`
- **Why it mattered:** A marketplace repo without health probes, CI gates, release context, and a documented database workflow is easy to break and slow to recover during incidents.
- **What was done:**
  - Added a GitHub Actions CI workflow that runs `npm ci`, `npm run check`, and `npm run test` on pull requests to `main`.
  - Added a real `/api/health` probe and release/environment tagging for Sentry events, plus release env wiring in Next config.
  - Added rate-limit observability hooks and an admin override API backed by a new `rate_limit_overrides` table.
  - Expanded `.env.example` with descriptions and added a Supabase workflow guide plus npm aliases for reset/push commands.
- **Verification:** `npm run check`; `npm run test`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-19` — Admin dispute visibility, payment observability, and trust-surface polish
- **When:** 2026-04-01
- **By:** Codex
- **Files changed:** `src/lib/data/admin.ts`, `src/app/(admin)/admin/disputes/page.tsx`, `src/app/(admin)/admin/disputes/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/app/(admin)/admin/payments/page.tsx`, `src/components/ui/badge.tsx`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `src/app/globals.css`, `src/components/ui/button.tsx`, `src/components/ui/card.tsx`
- **Why it mattered:** Ops needs faster dispute triage and payment visibility, while the customer/carrier surfaces need consistent status language and accessible interaction styling to feel trustworthy.
- **What was done:**
  - Added dispute ownership/SLA markers in the admin list and a dedicated evidence-gallery detail page for uploaded dispute photos.
  - Added an admin payments page that summarizes payment failures, authorization cancellations, refunds, and booking-level payment issues in one view.
  - Introduced a shared `StatusBadge` system and tightened common card, focus-ring, dark-mode, and button primitives so states read consistently across the app.
- **Verification:** `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-01` — Atomic booking creation and conflict-safe capacity handling
- Moved from active backlog: original `A4` and `A12`
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `supabase/migrations/008_atomic_booking_function.sql`
  - `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`
  - `src/types/database.ts`
- Why:
  - Booking creation previously used a read-then-write flow, which left the app exposed to oversell when two customers booked the same listing at nearly the same time.
  - The frontend also needed a reliable way to distinguish “listing is full” from a generic 500.
- What changed:
  - Added a new `create_booking_atomic` Postgres function that locks the listing row, recalculates pricing inside the transaction, inserts the booking, writes the initial booking event, and updates listing capacity/status before releasing the lock.
  - Switched `createBookingForCustomer` to call the RPC instead of directly inserting into `bookings`.
  - Added typed RPC args in `src/types/database.ts`.
  - Mapped `listing_not_bookable` to an application-level `409` conflict so the UI can handle a full listing as a product state instead of a server failure.
  - Added a cancellation-side capacity/status recalculation path so cancelled bookings do not leave the listing in the wrong availability state.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-02` — API hardening for uploads and cross-origin POST requests
- Moved from active backlog: `A2`, `A3`, `A8`
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/app/api/upload/route.ts`
  - `middleware.ts`
- Why:
  - File uploads accepted too much trust from the client and lacked a hard content-length guard.
  - Booking and payment POST routes lacked origin validation.
- What changed:
  - Added a 10MB pre-parse upload limit based on `Content-Length`.
  - Added explicit MIME allowlisting for images plus `image/heic`, `image/heif`, and PDF uploads.
  - Added CSRF-style origin checks for mutating `/api/bookings/*` and `/api/payments/*` routes, while keeping `/api/payments/webhook` exempt.
  - Expanded middleware matchers so API routes are actually protected by the new logic.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-03` — Trip date validation, text sanitization, and production env enforcement
- Moved from active backlog: `A1`, `A6`, `A7`, `A11`
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/lib/validation/trip.ts`
  - `src/lib/validation/booking.ts`
  - `src/lib/utils.ts`
  - `src/app/api/trips/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts`
  - `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Why:
  - Carriers could submit past-dated trips.
  - Booking and trip free text needed normalization before persistence.
  - Production env validation existed but was not actually enforced at runtime.
- What changed:
  - Added reusable date refinement so both `tripSchema` and `tripUpdateSchema` reject past dates.
  - Added `sanitizeText()` and applied it to booking text fields plus trip create/update API payloads.
  - Wired `assertRequiredEnv()` into the root server layout so missing production env vars fail fast rather than surfacing as broken runtime behavior later.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-04` — Proper customer-facing not-found flows for trips and bookings
- Moved from active backlog: `A9`, `A10`
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/app/(customer)/trip/[id]/not-found.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/bookings/[id]/not-found.tsx`
- Why:
  - Missing or unauthorized resources should resolve to a deliberate recovery path, not an empty or confusing page state.
- What changed:
  - Added dedicated not-found pages for trip detail and booking detail.
  - Preserved the existing `notFound()` calls in the route pages and gave them helpful recovery links back to `/search` and `/bookings`.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-05` — Booking flow clarity: retryable payment setup, stepper, and form counters
- Moved from active backlog: `B4`, `B7`, `B11`
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/components/booking/booking-form.tsx`
  - `src/components/booking/booking-status-stepper.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/bookings/[id]/page.tsx`
- Why:
  - Payment setup failures were generic and easy to misunderstand.
  - Booking detail status needed a clearer progress UI.
  - Booking form text input lacked feedback on limits.
- What changed:
  - Added clearer payment setup messaging and a retry path when booking creation succeeds but payment-intent creation fails.
  - Added a dedicated booking status stepper and replaced the old text-only list in booking detail.
  - Made item description controlled and added a live `n/200` counter.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-06` — Carrier onboarding and admin action feedback
- Moved from active backlog: `B5`, `B6`, `B12`, `B18`
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/components/carrier/carrier-onboarding-form.tsx`
  - `src/components/admin/verify-carrier-actions.tsx`
  - `src/components/carrier/carrier-trip-wizard.tsx`
  - `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/trips/page.tsx`
- Why:
  - Uploading docs felt opaque.
  - Admin verification actions needed clear async feedback.
  - Carrier special notes needed limit visibility.
  - After trip posting, there was no obvious path back to the dashboard.
- What changed:
  - Added onboarding document progress UI, upload percent feedback, and green checkmarks for successful uploads.
  - Added spinners to approve/reject actions.
  - Added live `n/280` counter for carrier trip special notes.
  - Added a success banner on the carrier trips page with a direct “Go to dashboard” action after posting.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-07` — iOS-first interaction and touch polish
- Moved from active backlog: `C1`, `C2`, `C3`, `C7`, `C8`
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/components/carrier/carrier-trip-wizard.tsx`
  - `src/components/booking/status-update-actions.tsx`
  - `src/components/booking/dispute-form.tsx`
  - `src/app/globals.css`
  - `src/components/layout/site-header.tsx`
  - `src/components/ui/button.tsx`
- Why:
  - The product is intended to be iPhone-first, so hover-only feedback and undersized tap experiences are bugs, not polish.
- What changed:
  - Replaced carrier wizard checkbox inputs with custom button-style toggles and hidden inputs.
  - Added `capture="environment"` and explicit HEIC/HEIF support to proof-photo flows.
  - Added safe-area variables, overscroll containment, and global `focus-visible` styling.
  - Added `active:` states to header links and core button variants.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-08` — Browse/search clarity improvements
- Moved from active backlog: `B1`, `B2`, `B13`, `B14`
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/app/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/search/page.tsx`
  - `src/components/customer/waitlist-form.tsx`
  - `src/components/trip/trip-card.tsx`
- Why:
  - MVP value proposition needs to land immediately on 375px mobile screens.
  - Empty search states should convert uncertainty into a concrete next step.
  - Trust signals should exist at browse-time, not only inside the trip detail page.
- What changed:
  - Moved the landing-page value explanation above the search form.
  - Reframed the search empty state around “Get notified” and updated the CTA copy.
  - Added carrier rating/review count on trip cards.
  - Switched the browse-stage verified badge to an explicit green trust signal.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-09` — Search date defaults no longer go stale
- Discovered during implementation pass, not originally listed
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/lib/utils.ts`
  - `src/components/search/search-bar.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/search/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/page.tsx`
- Why:
  - The app was still seeded with a hardcoded March 2026 date. As time moved forward, search defaults and sample links would silently feel broken.
- What changed:
  - Added `getTodayIsoDate()` and used it for the search form default date, search-page fallback date, and landing-page sample search link.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-10` — Workspace typecheck now targets the product, not the reference folders
- Discovered during verification, not originally listed
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `tsconfig.json`
- Why:
  - `tsc --noEmit` was walking reference folders such as `other best projects- only for ideas/`, which produced thousands of irrelevant type errors unrelated to moverrr.
- What changed:
  - Narrowed the TypeScript include/exclude rules so checks run against the actual app workspace plus Next-generated types.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-16` — Search accessibility, pending-booking clarity, and live verification/dashboard surfaces
- Moved from active backlog: `BUG-01`, `BUG-08`, `BUG-16`, `BUG-18`, `BUG-21`
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/components/shared/google-autocomplete-input.tsx`
  - `src/components/booking/pending-expiry-countdown.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/bookings/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `src/components/admin/verification-queue.tsx`
  - `src/app/(admin)/admin/verification/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(admin)/admin/carriers/page.tsx`
  - `src/components/admin/verify-carrier-actions.tsx`
  - `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Why:
  - Address selection relied on Google’s default widget, which did not expose reliable keyboard selection or ARIA relationships.
  - Pending bookings did not explain the 2-hour carrier response window clearly enough.
  - The admin verification screen was still a checklist placeholder even though carrier review data already existed.
  - Carrier dashboard summary cards still showed placeholder math instead of operationally trustworthy numbers.
- What changed:
  - Replaced the Google Places widget wrapper with a custom combobox-style autocomplete that supports `ArrowUp`, `ArrowDown`, `Enter`, `Escape`, `role="listbox"`, `role="option"`, and `aria-activedescendant`.
  - Added a live pending-booking expiry card that counts down from `created_at + 2h` and switches to an auto-expiry message once the window has elapsed.
  - Replaced the admin verification checklist shell with a live carrier queue, including real document/service-area context and lightweight review notes persisted in `localStorage`.
  - Extended verification actions so review notes flow through to the API and DB-backed carrier notes when approve/reject is used.
  - Replaced placeholder carrier dashboard cards with real listing/booking-derived counts and payout math, and surfaced per-trip status plus remaining capacity in the list.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-17` — Payment lifecycle semantics, structured webhook context, and proportional capacity recovery
- Moved from active backlog: `BUG-09`, `BUG-10`, `BUG-11`, `BUG-12`, `BUG-17`, `BUG-23`, `BUG-25`
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `config/required-production-env.json`
  - `next.config.js`
  - `src/lib/env.ts`
  - `src/lib/utils.ts`
  - `src/app/api/bookings/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts`
  - `src/lib/booking-capacity.ts`
  - `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`
  - `src/lib/data/admin.ts`
  - `src/components/admin/resolve-dispute-actions.tsx`
  - `supabase/migrations/010_capacity_recalculation.sql`
- Why:
  - Production env validation still happened too late in the runtime path.
  - Free-text sanitization still allowed pasted HTML tags through.
  - Booking conflict responses were not consistently serialized for frontend handling.
  - Payment status transitions blurred “intent created” and “authorization confirmed.”
  - Webhook incident review still lacked explicit operator-facing log context.
  - Booking cancellation recovery still depended on a flat 25% capacity heuristic.
- What changed:
  - Added a shared required-env manifest and enforced it from `next.config.js` so production builds fail before deployment when critical env vars are missing.
  - Upgraded `sanitizeText()` to strip HTML tags before normalizing whitespace.
  - Updated `/api/bookings` to return `{ error, code }` payloads, including the `409` `listing_not_bookable` case.
  - Changed payment-intent creation to record the Stripe intent ID without prematurely marking the booking as `authorized`, and renamed the booking event to `payment_intent_created`.
  - Tightened webhook updates so `payment_intent.amount_capturable_updated` marks bookings `authorized`, `payment_intent.succeeded` marks them `captured`, and failure/missing-row paths emit structured console context alongside Sentry capture.
  - Added visible loading ownership to admin dispute actions and routed dispute-driven booking status changes back through the shared booking transition helper.
  - Replaced flat 25% capacity math with dimension/weight/category-based capacity estimation in both the app layer and the booking RPC, and recalculated listing capacity from active bookings instead of incrementing/decrementing blindly.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-13` — Local-date handling and demo data now roll forward automatically
- Discovered during backlog pass; this advances but does not fully close `BUG-20`
- When: `2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/lib/utils.ts`
  - `src/lib/demo-data.ts`
- Why:
  - `toISOString()`-based date defaults can drift relative to the user’s local day, and demo inventory should not silently age into the past.
- What changed:
  - Updated `getTodayIsoDate()` to derive the local calendar date instead of the raw UTC date.
  - Switched demo trip dates to relative future dates so sample inventory remains current without hand-editing constants.
- Verification:
  - `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-18` — Server-side pending booking expiry runner
- **When:** `2026-04-01`
- **By:** `Codex`
- **Files changed:** `supabase/functions/expire-bookings/index.ts`, `supabase/migrations/011_booking_safety_p0.sql`, `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/lib/notifications.ts`, `src/types/database.ts`
- **Why it mattered:** Pending bookings that never expire lock real trip capacity and make carrier supply feel unreliable.
- **What was done:**
  - Added a scheduled expiry edge function that finds stale `pending` bookings, cancels them with an explicit expiry reason, records audit events, recalculates listing capacity, and notifies both parties.
  - Added `pending_expires_at` plus a reusable database `recalculate_listing_capacity` function so expiry and cancellation paths restore inventory consistently.
  - Added an application helper for expiring pending bookings through the same booking lifecycle rules when run from server code.
- **Verification:** `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-19` — Payment-intent creation is now idempotent per booking
- **When:** `2026-04-01`
- **By:** `Codex`
- **Files changed:** `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`
- **Why it mattered:** Mobile retries must resolve to one authoritative Stripe intent or support loses the ability to reason about payment state cleanly.
- **What was done:**
  - Reused existing non-cancelled Stripe payment intents when the stored intent still matches the booking amount, currency, and metadata.
  - Switched Stripe intent creation to use a booking-scoped idempotency key so retries land on the same intent even if the first response path is interrupted.
  - Added booking reference metadata to the payment intent for easier reconciliation.
- **Verification:** `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-20` — Booking creation now honors client idempotency keys
- **When:** `2026-04-01`
- **By:** `Codex`
- **Files changed:** `supabase/migrations/011_booking_safety_p0.sql`, `src/app/api/bookings/route.ts`, `src/components/booking/booking-form.tsx`, `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/types/database.ts`
- **Why it mattered:** Double-submits from iPhone taps or flaky mobile networks must never create two bookings for the same customer intent.
- **What was done:**
  - Added `booking_idempotency_keys` with a 24-hour expiry window and folded the claim/return logic into the atomic booking RPC.
  - Accepted the `Idempotency-Key` header on booking creation and passed a request hash into the RPC so mismatched payload reuse is rejected safely.
  - Updated the booking form to generate and send a client idempotency key on submit.
- **Verification:** `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-21` — Duplicate booking lifecycle emails are suppressed
- **When:** `2026-04-01`
- **By:** `Codex`
- **Files changed:** `supabase/migrations/011_booking_safety_p0.sql`, `src/lib/notifications.ts`, `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/lib/data/admin.ts`, `src/lib/data/feedback.ts`, `src/types/database.ts`
- **Why it mattered:** Duplicate lifecycle emails erode trust faster than a delayed email and make retried booking transitions look unstable.
- **What was done:**
  - Added `booking_email_deliveries` with a unique dedupe key so booking-related emails can be claimed before send and skipped on retry.
  - Routed booking creation, booking status, dispute, review, and expiry emails through the deduped send path.
  - Preserved the local-development graceful-degradation behavior by releasing the dedupe claim when email sending is skipped or fails.
- **Verification:** `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-22` — Human-readable booking references are now first-class
- **When:** `2026-04-01`
- **By:** `Codex`
- **Files changed:** `supabase/migrations/011_booking_safety_p0.sql`, `src/app/(admin)/admin/bookings/page.tsx`, `src/app/(admin)/admin/disputes/page.tsx`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/trips/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/app/(customer)/bookings/page.tsx`, `src/app/(customer)/bookings/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/app/api/admin/bookings/route.ts`, `src/components/booking/pending-expiry-countdown.tsx`, `src/components/carrier/live-bookings-list.tsx`, `src/lib/data/admin.ts`, `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/lib/data/feedback.ts`, `src/lib/data/mappers.ts`, `src/lib/demo-data.ts`, `src/types/booking.ts`, `src/types/database.ts`
- **Why it mattered:** Support and ops cannot work efficiently off UUIDs alone; every booking needs a short reference that appears everywhere people actually use the system.
- **What was done:**
  - Added generated `MVR-YYYY-NNNN` booking references at the database layer so every booking gets a support-safe identifier at creation time.
  - Surfaced the reference in customer booking lists/detail, carrier trip booking cards, admin bookings, admin disputes, and booking-related emails.
  - Added admin booking search by reference so ops can find a booking from the short code instead of raw IDs.
- **Verification:** `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-23` — Carrier posting and onboarding are now mobile-resilient and conversion-ready
- **When:** `2026-04-01`
- **By:** `Codex`
- **Files changed:** `supabase/migrations/012_p1_p2_marketplace_experience.sql`, `src/lib/constants.ts`, `src/lib/validation/trip.ts`, `src/lib/validation/carrier.ts`, `src/lib/data/carriers.ts`, `src/lib/data/trips.ts`, `src/lib/data/listings.ts`, `src/types/carrier.ts`, `src/types/database.ts`, `src/types/trip.ts`, `src/components/carrier/carrier-trip-wizard.tsx`, `src/components/carrier/carrier-onboarding-form.tsx`, `src/components/carrier/trip-edit-form.tsx`, `src/components/carrier/carrier-post-prefill.tsx`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/post/page.tsx`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/onboarding/page.tsx`, `src/components/admin/verification-queue.tsx`, `src/components/shared/google-autocomplete-input.tsx`, `src/app/api/trips/price-guidance/route.ts`, `src/app/api/upload/route.ts`, `src/lib/storage.ts`
- **Why it mattered:** First-trip posting and carrier verification are the supply bottlenecks for moverrr, so the mobile flow has to survive interruptions and explain exactly what a carrier needs next.
- **What was done:**
  - Added a return-trip flag, sticky safe-area wizard footer, detour presets, special-notes chips, and route price-guidance fetches so posting feels faster and clearer on iPhone-sized screens.
  - Reworked trip editing with dirty-state protection and long-form auth refresh so carriers do not silently lose edits after stepping away mid-session.
  - Rebuilt onboarding around autosave/resume, document previews, expiry-date capture, vehicle-photo upload, and a verification-blockers card that explains why an account cannot be approved yet.
  - Extended the carrier and admin data surfaces so verification review includes the new vehicle and document metadata instead of raw upload links only.
- **Verification:** `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-24` — Booking lifecycle recovery and payment-state trust surfaces were hardened
- **When:** `2026-04-01`
- **By:** `Codex`
- **Files changed:** `supabase/migrations/012_p1_p2_marketplace_experience.sql`, `src/lib/constants.ts`, `src/lib/booking-presenters.ts`, `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/types/booking.ts`, `src/types/database.ts`, `src/app/api/bookings/[id]/route.ts`, `src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts`, `src/components/booking/booking-form.tsx`, `src/components/booking/dispute-form.tsx`, `src/components/booking/status-update-actions.tsx`, `src/components/booking/payment-recovery-card.tsx`, `src/components/booking/private-proof-tile.tsx`, `src/components/booking/print-receipt-button.tsx`, `src/components/ui/file-selection-preview.tsx`, `src/app/(customer)/bookings/page.tsx`, `src/app/(customer)/bookings/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/trips/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/app/(admin)/admin/bookings/page.tsx`
- **Why it mattered:** A marketplace loses trust fastest when a booking looks stuck, proof feels risky to submit, or money states are ambiguous after a payment problem.
- **What was done:**
  - Added retryable payment-recovery UI, explicit authorization-cancelled vs refunded states, and presenter helpers so booking detail, carrier views, and admin tools all describe payment status consistently.
  - Added proof preview and remove-before-submit flows, HEIC/HEIF-safe upload handling, guided dispute categories, and structured cancellation reasons instead of free-text-only actions.
  - Rebuilt customer booking detail around the pending-expiry countdown, preparation checklist, private proof gallery, printable receipt, and a “book similar trip” recovery path after completion.
  - Stored payment failure codes and cancellation reason codes in the data model so support and webhook processing preserve the actual failure reason instead of flattening everything into generic errors.
- **Verification:** `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-25` — Customer browse surfaces, carrier transparency, and reminder loops were expanded for conversion
- **When:** `2026-04-01`
- **By:** `Codex`
- **Files changed:** `supabase/migrations/012_p1_p2_marketplace_experience.sql`, `src/lib/constants.ts`, `src/lib/data/listings.ts`, `src/lib/data/templates.ts`, `src/lib/data/trips.ts`, `src/lib/data/mappers.ts`, `src/types/trip.ts`, `src/app/api/search/route.ts`, `src/app/(customer)/search/page.tsx`, `src/components/search/search-bar.tsx`, `src/components/trip/trip-card.tsx`, `src/components/trip/trip-detail-summary.tsx`, `src/components/trip/share-trip-button.tsx`, `src/components/ui/time-bar.tsx`, `src/app/(customer)/trip/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/app/(customer)/trip/[id]/opengraph-image.tsx`, `src/app/(customer)/carrier/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/components/layout/app-client-effects.tsx`, `src/hooks/useAuthRefresh.ts`, `supabase/functions/delivery-reminders/index.ts`, `supabase/functions/trip-expiry-reminders/index.ts`, `supabase/functions/doc-expiry-reminders/index.ts`
- **Why it mattered:** Browse-first demand only converts if empty states stay useful, listing cards communicate spare-capacity value quickly, and both sides get reminder nudges before trust-breaking no-shows or expiries.
- **What was done:**
  - Added browse-by-category search chips, nearby-date fallback results, clear geocoding-failure messaging, time-window bars, capacity indicators, and return-trip context on search and trip cards.
  - Expanded trip detail with a savings context block, share action, richer OG image metadata, and a public carrier profile so customers can evaluate supply quality before committing.
  - Added reminder edge-function scaffolding for delivery follow-ups, expiring trips, and expiring carrier documents so the marketplace has scheduled hooks for key pre- and post-job nudges.
  - Kept long-lived customer sessions warm from the root app layer so saved-search, browse, and booking flows degrade less often when a mobile user leaves and returns.
- **Verification:** `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-26` — Admin verification queue now surfaces document expiry risk
- **When:** `2026-04-01`
- **By:** `Codex`
- **Files changed:** `src/components/admin/verification-queue.tsx`, `src/app/(admin)/admin/verification/page.tsx`
- **Why it mattered:** Expiring licence or insurance documents are a trust and compliance risk, so approvers need that signal before they click approve.
- **What was done:**
  - Added expiry-state badges for carrier licence and insurance documents with healthy, review-soon, and immediate-action states.
  - Re-sorted the queue so carriers with stale or expiring documents rise above healthier carriers.
  - Added summary counters and a bulk-selection bar so review-ready carriers are easier to process in batches.
- **Verification:** `npx eslint 'src/app/(admin)/admin/bookings/page.tsx' 'src/app/(admin)/admin/disputes/page.tsx' 'src/app/(admin)/admin/disputes/[id]/page.tsx' 'src/app/(admin)/admin/verification/page.tsx' 'src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/page.tsx' 'src/components/admin/copy-text-button.tsx' 'src/components/admin/admin-booking-support-panel.tsx' 'src/components/admin/admin-pagination.tsx' 'src/components/admin/ops-funnel-card.tsx' 'src/components/admin/resolve-dispute-actions.tsx' 'src/components/admin/verification-queue.tsx' 'src/components/admin/verify-carrier-actions.tsx'`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-27` — Booking transitions, payments, and upload boundaries were hardened
- **When:** `2026-04-01`
- **By:** `Codex`
- **Files changed:** `middleware.ts`, `src/app/api/bookings/route.ts`, `src/app/api/bookings/[id]/route.ts`, `src/app/api/bookings/[id]/dispute/route.ts`, `src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts`, `src/app/api/upload/route.ts`, `src/lib/constants.ts`, `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/lib/data/feedback.ts`, `src/lib/data/trips.ts`, `src/lib/validation/booking.ts`, `src/types/booking.ts`, `src/types/database.ts`, `supabase/migrations/014_booking_payment_capture_failed.sql`
- **Why it mattered:** Silent capture failures, unsafe actor transitions, and weak upload validation were the highest-trust risks left in the booking lifecycle.
- **What was done:**
  - Wrapped Stripe capture in guarded completion logic that marks `capture_failed`, records failure detail, and blocks completion when capture does not actually succeed.
  - Fixed actor-role resolution so dual-role users can still access the right booking path and customers can no longer self-confirm carrier-side states.
  - Expanded CSRF protection to mutating booking/payment routes, added booking creation rate limiting, and tightened dispute-state transitions through the real state machine.
  - Added upload throttling plus magic-byte validation so proof and item-photo buckets reject mismatched or unsafe file types server-side.
- **Verification:** `npm run check`; `npm run test`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-28` — Customer browse and booking surfaces now reflect live intent more clearly
- **When:** `2026-04-01`
- **By:** `Codex`
- **Files changed:** `src/app/(customer)/bookings/page.tsx`, `src/app/(customer)/bookings/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/app/(customer)/search/page.tsx`, `src/app/(customer)/trip/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/components/booking/booking-checkout-panel.tsx`, `src/components/booking/booking-form.tsx`, `src/components/booking/booking-status-stepper.tsx`, `src/components/booking/price-breakdown.tsx`, `src/components/booking/sticky-booking-cta.tsx`, `src/components/search/search-bar.tsx`, `src/components/trip/trip-card.tsx`, `src/types/booking.ts`, `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`
- **Why it mattered:** Browse-first demand converts better when pricing updates instantly, search starts cleanly, and customers can coordinate confidently once a trip is confirmed.
- **What was done:**
  - Reworked trip detail and booking form flow with a live checkout panel, sticky mobile CTA, session-backed draft restore, progress states, and a single truthful savings figure.
  - Added empty-state recovery paths for bookings/search, URL-persisted sort controls, and desktop-first search autofocus without hardcoded suburbs.
  - Fixed booking detail evidence timestamps, added a full timeline, surfaced carrier contact info for active jobs, and kept “book similar trip” recovery in the completed state.
  - Tightened trip-card CTA language so search results feel like a clear booking surface rather than a passive listing index.
- **Verification:** `npm run check`; `npm run test`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-29` — Carrier onboarding, posting, and dashboard feedback loops became more actionable
- **When:** `2026-04-01`
- **By:** `Codex`
- **Files changed:** `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/dashboard/page.tsx`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/onboarding/actions.ts`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/onboarding/page.tsx`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/payouts/page.tsx`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/post/page.tsx`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/stats/page.tsx`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/trips/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/components/carrier/carrier-onboarding-form.tsx`, `src/components/carrier/carrier-post-prefill.tsx`, `src/components/carrier/carrier-post-success-card.tsx`, `src/components/carrier/carrier-trip-wizard.tsx`, `src/components/carrier/pending-bookings-alert.tsx`, `src/components/carrier/trip-checklist.tsx`, `src/components/carrier/trip-edit-form.tsx`, `src/lib/data/trips.ts`, `src/lib/validation/carrier.ts`, `src/lib/validation/trip.ts`
- **Why it mattered:** Supply grows faster when first-trip carriers are guided around readiness blockers and repeat carriers can act on pending demand immediately.
- **What was done:**
  - Added per-step validation, readiness gating, debounced price guidance, onboarding return redirects, and a real success state after posting a trip.
  - Scoped onboarding drafts by user, added ABN validation, and surfaced clearer verification readiness throughout the carrier flow.
  - Upgraded carrier dashboards with pending-booking urgency, active-vs-past trip separation, and clearer payouts/performance empty states for new carriers.
  - Expanded trip editing so carriers can actually update accepted categories, stairs support, and helper surcharges instead of cancel-and-repost workarounds.
- **Verification:** `npm run check`; `npm run test`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-30` — Admin support views and shared verification context were upgraded
- **When:** `2026-04-01`
- **By:** `Codex`
- **Files changed:** `src/app/(admin)/admin/bookings/page.tsx`, `src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`, `src/app/(admin)/admin/disputes/page.tsx`, `src/app/(admin)/admin/verification/page.tsx`, `src/app/api/admin/bookings/route.ts`, `src/app/api/admin/carriers/[id]/route.ts`, `src/app/api/admin/carriers/[id]/verify/route.ts`, `src/app/api/admin/disputes/[id]/route.ts`, `src/components/admin/admin-booking-support-panel.tsx`, `src/components/admin/admin-pagination.tsx`, `src/components/admin/copy-text-button.tsx`, `src/components/admin/ops-funnel-card.tsx`, `src/components/admin/resolve-dispute-actions.tsx`, `src/components/admin/verification-queue.tsx`, `src/lib/data/admin.ts`, `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/lib/data/carriers.ts`
- **Why it mattered:** Early ops speed depends on fast booking lookup, visible dispute urgency, and shared admin context instead of one-browser-only notes.
- **What was done:**
  - Added admin booking search by booking reference or email, real pagination, and a quick-view support panel for the most common investigation details.
  - Added dispute urgency signals, mandatory resolution notes, and booking-event audit metadata for dispute closures.
  - Added a funnel snapshot card on the admin dashboard so ops can see weekly flow drop-off instead of isolated headline metrics.
  - Moved carrier verification notes from local-only storage to debounced DB-backed autosave with local fallback, while preserving bulk verification actions.
- **Verification:** `npm run check`; `npm run test`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-31` — Runtime environment, health, and public metadata were tightened
- **When:** `2026-04-01`
- **By:** `Codex`
- **Files changed:** `.env.example`, `next.config.js`, `src/app/api/health/route.ts`, `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/robots.ts`, `src/app/sitemap.ts`, `src/lib/env.ts`
- **Why it mattered:** The app needs to fail fast on bad deploy config, expose a meaningful health signal, and publish safe metadata for iPhone and search surfaces.
- **What was done:**
  - Moved env enforcement to startup-oriented configuration, added security headers, and expanded `.env.example` to match the real runtime surface.
  - Added a health endpoint that checks DB/env/payment readiness instead of returning a blind OK.
  - Added robots and sitemap generation for public trip discovery, plus viewport-fit and theme-color metadata for safer iOS rendering.
  - Updated the search page to the async `searchParams` shape expected by newer Next.js routing behavior.
- **Verification:** `npm run check`

### `COMP-2026-04-01-32` — Regression coverage now protects core pricing, status, and seed assumptions
- **When:** `2026-04-01`
- **By:** `Codex`
- **Files changed:** `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `src/lib/__tests__/breakdown.test.ts`, `src/lib/__tests__/seed.test.ts`, `src/lib/__tests__/status-machine.test.ts`
- **Why it mattered:** Commission math, booking transitions, and future-dated demo data are product truths that should not drift quietly between backlog passes.
- **What was done:**
  - Added status-machine tests for documented valid and invalid transitions.
  - Added pricing breakdown regression tests that lock the identity equation and base-only commission behavior.
  - Added seed-data regression tests that verify listings stay relative-dated and avoid hardcoded calendar values.
  - Wired a lightweight `npm run test` path into the repo so these invariants run alongside the normal checks.
- **Verification:** `npm run test`; `npm run check`

## Already Present In Repo Before This Pass

> These capabilities were already implemented in the workspace before the 2026-04-01 Codex pass. Exact ship dates are not recoverable from the current workspace alone, so they are recorded as “pre-2026-04-01”.

### `BASELINE-01` — Browse-first marketplace shell
- When: pre-`2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/app/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/search/page.tsx`
  - `src/components/trip/`
- What was already done:
  - Landing page, public search, and trip-card browse surfaces existed and were wired into the browse-first spare-capacity model.
- Why it matters:
  - This is the core product wedge: inventory-first discovery rather than quote-first demand collection.

### `BASELINE-02` — Carrier onboarding, trip posting, and trip editing
- When: pre-`2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/onboarding/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/post/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/trips/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `src/components/carrier/`
- What was already done:
  - Carriers could onboard, upload documents, post trips, and edit live listings.
- Why it matters:
  - Supply creation is the MVP bottleneck; this baseline already gave moverrr a usable carrier-side core.

### `BASELINE-03` — Customer booking lifecycle pages
- When: pre-`2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/app/(customer)/trip/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/bookings/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(customer)/bookings/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `src/components/booking/`
- What was already done:
  - Booking creation, booking detail, review submission, dispute intake, and proof-backed status management were already represented in the app.
- Why it matters:
  - This meant the product already had an end-to-end customer journey before today’s hardening work.

### `BASELINE-04` — Admin operations surfaces
- When: pre-`2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/app/(admin)/admin/*`
  - `src/components/admin/*`
  - `src/lib/data/admin.ts`
- What was already done:
  - Admin dashboards, carrier review helpers, dispute resolution flows, and bootstrap tooling already existed in the repo.
- Why it matters:
  - Even as an MVP, moverrr already had the beginnings of an operations layer rather than being customer/carrier only.

### `BASELINE-05` — Notifications and webhook safety checks already existed
- When: pre-`2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `src/lib/notifications.ts`
  - `src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts`
- What was already done:
  - Email send failures were already being captured to Sentry.
  - Stripe webhook updates already checked for missing booking rows rather than assuming the update succeeded.
- Why it matters:
  - These were two important safety items from the guide that did not need reimplementation.

### `BASELINE-06` — Core data model, matching RPC, and typed Supabase integration
- When: pre-`2026-04-01`
- Where:
  - `supabase/migrations/001` through `007`
  - `src/lib/data/*`
  - `src/types/database.ts`
- What was already done:
  - PostGIS, core marketplace tables, matching RPCs, RLS policies, indexes, and typed database access were already in place.
- Why it matters:
  - The product already had a real backend shape suitable for continuing toward an MVP, rather than a frontend-only shell.
