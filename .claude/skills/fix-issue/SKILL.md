# Fix Issue

Use `$ARGUMENTS` to specify the issue number (e.g. `#42`).

## Step 1 — Thesis Check

Before touching code, confirm the issue fits MoveMate's thesis:

1. Does fixing this help carriers post real spare capacity, or improve customer trust/clarity?
2. Does it keep the need-first, match-ranked model intact?
3. Is it the smallest version worth shipping now?

If the answer to any of these is unclear, flag it to the founder before continuing.

## Step 2 — Understand the Issue

1. Read the issue in full.
2. Trace the relevant code path from the issue description.
3. State the root cause or the gap in one sentence before proposing a fix.

Do not start implementation until you can state the root cause clearly.

## Step 3 — Implement

- Smallest complete change only.
- No unrelated refactors.
- No changes to commission math without explicit discussion.
- Keep iOS-first invariants intact.
- If the change touches bookings, pricing, or payments — read the booking-safety-audit context first.

## Step 4 — Verify

Run the `/verify-movemate-change` skill scoped to the changed area.

Minimum before the PR is ready:
1. `npm run check` passes
2. The changed path was directly exercised (not just "reads fine")
3. At least one adversarial input was tried and named in the report

Verification is not optional. If it could not be run, state exactly why in the PR body under "Residual risk." Do not skip this step and mark the work done anyway.

## Step 5 — PR

- Branch: `fix/issue-{number}-{slug}`
- PR title: references the issue number
- PR body: root cause, change summary, verification evidence

Add `Closes #N` to the PR body so GitHub auto-closes the issue on merge. If related issues exist, link them with `Related to #N`.
