# Docs + Memory Rules

Documentation in this repo is part of the agent runtime, not an afterthought.

## Where Truth Belongs

- `AGENTS.md`
  Universal, cross-tool, always-on truth (product thesis, invariants, parallelism, review model, verification bar)
- `CLAUDE.md`
  Claude Code overlay — additive tool-specific workflow only, never redeclares universal truth
- `AUTHORITY.md`
  Meta-map: which file is authoritative, alias policy, reference-only trees
- `.claude/rules/*.md`
  Scoped instructions that should load only for certain files
- `.agent-skills/*.md`
  Domain facts and flow-level context
- `.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`
  Reusable workflows and runbooks
- `TASK-RULES.md`
  Backlog OS quick-reference pointer (full work OS: `.claude/project-ops.md`)
- `README.md`
  Human-facing repo orientation

## Writing Rules

- Keep always-loaded docs lean
- Move specialized detail into rules or skills
- Prefer one canonical source over duplicated summaries
- Delete stale instructions instead of stacking new text beside them
- If a feature is already shipped, do not keep a "future feature brief" where a real workflow or reference doc should exist
- When docs conflict, the narrower scoped file wins until the stale file is corrected or deleted
- Rule files should use narrow `paths` and subsystem-level kebab-case names
- Capability indexes and workflow catalogs should point to canonical sources rather than restating them inline

## Required Sync Behavior

Update docs in the same task when you change:
- product rules
- verification commands
- workflow steps
- route structure
- agent or skill setup
- naming that future agents will rely on

## Task Tracking Files

`docs/operations/todolist.md` and `docs/operations/completed.md` are special-purpose files.
Do not touch them unless the task actually changes backlog state or the user asked for backlog grooming.

## Compounding Memory Rule

If you have to correct the same mistake twice, encode it as a standing instruction.

- First occurrence: fix it inline, no standing rule needed.
- Second occurrence of the same mistake: add a rule in `docs-and-memory.md` or the relevant scoped rule file. Keep it one sentence.
- If the correction applies everywhere across every tool, add it to `AGENTS.md` (universal). If it applies only to a single tool, add it to that tool's overlay (e.g. `CLAUDE.md`). If it applies only in one subsystem, add it to the relevant `.claude/rules/*.md`.
- Do not add a standing rule for one-off errors, exploratory missteps, or typos.

Corrections about the review process belong in the review-packet template or review-pr skill, not in `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`.

## Context Budget

Treat always-loaded docs as a scarce budget.
If detail is only useful for one subsystem or one workflow, move it closer to that work instead of expanding repo-wide prose.
