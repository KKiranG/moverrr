# MoveMate

MoveMate is a need-first, match-ranked spare-capacity marketplace for awkward-middle moves. Customers declare a move need once, see a short ranked set of route-compatible matches, request one driver or use Fast Match, and only release payout after proof-backed delivery.

This repository contains two things:

1. The MoveMate product application.
2. The repo operating system that lets shaped issues, smaller agents, reviewers, and release checks work safely in parallel.

## Read Order

Start here when you are orienting to the repo:

1. [AUTHORITY.md](/Users/kiranghimire/Documents/moverrr/AUTHORITY.md)
2. [AGENTS.md](/Users/kiranghimire/Documents/moverrr/AGENTS.md)
3. [CLAUDE.md](/Users/kiranghimire/Documents/moverrr/CLAUDE.md)
4. [.claude/project-ops.md](/Users/kiranghimire/Documents/moverrr/.claude/project-ops.md)
5. [.claude/lock-groups.md](/Users/kiranghimire/Documents/moverrr/.claude/lock-groups.md)
6. [movemate-product-blueprint.md](/Users/kiranghimire/Documents/moverrr/movemate-product-blueprint.md)

## Live Work System

GitHub is the live work system:

- Issues hold the shaped work unit.
- Labels, linked PRs, comments, and assignees hold live state.
- GitHub Project fields hold queue metadata when project scopes are available.

Markdown backlog files are derived artifacts only:

- [docs/operations/todolist.md](/Users/kiranghimire/Documents/moverrr/docs/operations/todolist.md)
- [docs/operations/completed.md](/Users/kiranghimire/Documents/moverrr/docs/operations/completed.md)

Do not use those files as a transactional queue.

## Product Truth

MoveMate is:

- need-first
- match-ranked
- spare-capacity
- trust-first
- structured pricing / booking / proof / payout aware

MoveMate is not:

- browse-first
- a quote marketplace
- a bidding marketplace
- a dispatch layer
- a generic removalist platform

Priority order:

`Trust -> Simplicity -> Supply speed -> Customer clarity -> Automation -> Polish`

## Stack

- Next.js 14
- React 18
- TypeScript
- Supabase
- Stripe
- Resend
- Vercel

## Commands

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
npm run check
npm run test
npm run build
npm run ops:labels
npm run ops:sync-backlog
```

## gstack

gstack is part of the approved workflow layer for this repo.

- Claude global install path: `~/.claude/skills/gstack`
- Codex global install path: `~/.codex/skills/gstack*`
- Claude repo hook: `.claude/hooks/check-gstack.sh`
- Use `/browse` from gstack for web browsing in Claude.

gstack helps with planning, review, QA, and ship loops. MoveMate product truth and repo-operating truth still come from the canonical docs in this repo.

## Naming Policy

The product name is `MoveMate`.

Some legacy technical identifiers still use `moverrr` because changing them in-place would create unnecessary breakage or migration churn. Those aliases are tracked in [AUTHORITY.md](/Users/kiranghimire/Documents/moverrr/AUTHORITY.md) and the operating docs until an isolated rename pass is ready.

## Reference-Only Imports

This repo contains imported gstack, OpenClaw, and other frontier-agent reference material at the root. Those folders are useful as patterns and tooling references, but they are not authoritative for MoveMate product truth or live task state unless a canonical doc explicitly points at them.
