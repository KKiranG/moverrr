# MoveMate Smoke Tests

GitHub issues, pull requests, and release comments are the execution record.
Use this page as the repeatable preview and production checklist.

## Pre-merge baseline

Run the baseline locally or in a clean branch environment before asking for merge:

1. `npm ci`
2. `npm run check`
3. `npm run test`
4. `npm run build`
5. Confirm the build finishes without Sentry setup warnings. Full event delivery verification still requires real Sentry DSNs and credentials.

## Preview deployment smoke

After the preview deploy finishes:

1. Load `/` and confirm the primary landing and search surfaces render without server errors.
2. Load `/login` and `/signup` to confirm auth routes are alive.
3. Call `/api/health`.
4. Expect `200` with `"overall":"ok"` when preview is wired to real services. If preview is intentionally partial, capture the degraded components in the PR before merge.
5. Confirm one customer-facing route and one carrier-facing route render with the expected environment banner or live data state.
6. Treat preview cron as manual verification only. Do not assume the platform will actually execute scheduled jobs in preview.

## Optional staging smoke

Run this only if staging exists as a distinct environment with its own secrets:

1. Confirm staging is documented in the linked GitHub issue or PR as an intentional environment, not an assumption.
2. Load `/api/health` and capture whether staging is expected to be fully wired or partially degraded.
3. Call cron routes manually with bearer auth if staging is the chosen rehearsal lane for scheduler behavior.
4. Record any known differences from production in the PR before merge.

## Non-production bootstrap smoke

Use this only outside production:

1. Sign in as an admin user listed in `ADMIN_EMAILS`.
2. POST to `/api/admin` with `{"action":"bootstrap","secret":"$SMOKE_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET"}`.
3. Re-run `/api/health` and confirm the intended smoke views can see demo trips or bookings.
4. Never use `SMOKE_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET` against production.

## Cron and webhook edge checks

1. Verify `vercel.json` still schedules `/api/cron/trip-freshness-checks` and `/api/cron/payout-auto-release`.
2. Confirm the default schedules remain hobby-safe daily crons unless the project has explicitly moved to a Vercel Pro plan.
3. If production needs hourly cron execution, record that dependency in GitHub before changing the schedule.
4. If `CRON_SECRET` or `VERCEL_CRON_SECRET` is set, call each cron route once with `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` and confirm a `200` response.
5. Confirm Stripe webhook secret rotation is reflected before replaying webhook traffic or validating payout flows.
6. If staging is absent, use preview or local for manual authenticated cron checks and keep production as the only trusted recurring scheduler.

## Ship gate

Do not mark a deploy healthy until CI is green, preview smoke is recorded, and any degraded `/api/health` component has an explicit owner in GitHub.
