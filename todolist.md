# moverrr — Active Backlog

> Last refreshed: `2026-04-12` — rebuilt against `/Users/kiranghimire/Documents/moverrr/claude-moverrr-governing-product-blueprint.md`
> Format governed by `TASK-RULES.md`. Move completed work to `completed.md` and never mark items done here.
> This backlog is a blueprint realignment pass. Preserve only work that strengthens the need-first, match-ranked, trust-structured spare-capacity marketplace.

---

## Blueprint Locks

- moverrr is a **need-first, match-ranked spare-capacity marketplace**. It is not a browse-first inventory product, quote board, bidding loop, dispatch layer, or removalist suite.
- The customer declares a move need first. The system returns a ranked answer set with deterministic total pricing, fit labels, trust signals, and a mandatory "Why this matches" explanation.
- The carrier experience is state-aware and action-led. Home is a work queue, not an analytics dashboard.
- Alert the Network replaces dead-end zero-result flows. Founder concierge is part of MVP but must route through system entities.
- Payment flow target: authorize on request submission, capture on acceptance, hold through fulfilment, release on customer confirmation or `72` hours after valid proof if no dispute exists.

## Working Assumptions

- `TASK-RULES.md` format takes precedence for every task item.
- `completed.md` stays untouched during this backlog rewrite.
- When the governing blueprint conflicts with older code, docs, or planning notes, the blueprint wins.
- The pricing direction is locked to **platform fee + GST in the customer total**. The old flat `$5` booking fee model is treated as superseded.
- Detour handling remains partially ambiguous in the blueprint. This backlog assumes detour estimation is allowed for eligibility, ranking, and explanation, but automatic detour-cost pricing needs an explicit founder decision before implementation.

## Coverage Notes

- Sections `1` through `17` of the governing blueprint are represented in active or deferred work below.
- P0 and P1 focus on product-shape correction and core model restructuring before polish or optimization work.
- P4 keeps later-phase work isolated so it does not leak back into the MVP queue.

## 🔴 P0 — Production Blocking

### Product / Scope Corrections

- [ ] **B07** — Demote public carrier storefront discovery as a primary customer path
  - **File(s):** `src/app/(customer)/carrier/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/components/trip/trip-card.tsx`
  - **What:** Remove or demote public carrier-profile loops that encourage browsing carriers outside a declared move need.
  - **Why:** The blueprint allows trust context, but not profile storefronts as the primary discovery model.
  - **Done when:** Carrier profile pages no longer act as a top-level discovery surface and are reached only from contextual trust flows.

### Data Model and Backend Logic

- [ ] **D01** — Add `MoveRequest` as a first-class persisted entity
  - **File(s):** `new file: supabase/migrations/017_move_requests_and_offers.sql`, `src/types/database.ts`, `new file: src/types/move-request.ts`
  - **What:** Introduce a structured `MoveRequest` table and TypeScript model that stores route, item, timing, access, and photo data before matching.
  - **Why:** The blueprint’s need-first flow depends on move requests existing independently of trips and bookings.
  - **Done when:** Schema and types support creating, reading, and validating move requests without going straight to bookings.

- [ ] **D02** — Add `Offer` as the ranked match output entity
  - **File(s):** `new file: supabase/migrations/017_move_requests_and_offers.sql`, `src/types/database.ts`, `src/lib/data/mappers.ts`
  - **What:** Persist matched offers with match class, explanation, fit confidence, detour estimate, and full price breakdown.
  - **Why:** The blueprint’s answer-set model needs an explicit offer layer between move requests and booking requests.
  - **Done when:** Offer records exist and can be assembled into Top Matches, Possible Matches, and Nearby Dates result groups.

- [ ] **D03** — Add `BookingRequest` and request-group support
  - **File(s):** `new file: supabase/migrations/018_booking_requests.sql`, `src/types/database.ts`, `new file: src/types/booking-request.ts`
  - **What:** Create the booking-request model, including `request_group_id` for Fast Match and explicit request statuses.
  - **Why:** The blueprint separates booking requests from confirmed bookings and requires group-level Fast Match logic.
  - **Done when:** Booking requests can be stored independently from bookings and grouped for Fast Match orchestration.

- [ ] **D04** — Add `ConditionAdjustment` as a one-round structured exception entity
  - **File(s):** `new file: supabase/migrations/019_condition_adjustments.sql`, `src/types/database.ts`, `new file: src/types/condition-adjustment.ts`
  - **What:** Model one structured post-arrival adjustment with predefined reason, amount, and customer response state.
  - **Why:** The blueprint permits one structured adjustment path while rejecting open negotiation.
  - **Done when:** The schema and types support a single condition adjustment per booking with a clear accepted or rejected outcome.

- [ ] **D05** — Add `UnmatchedRequest` for Alert the Network demand capture
  - **File(s):** `new file: supabase/migrations/020_unmatched_requests.sql`, `src/types/database.ts`, `new file: src/types/alert.ts`
  - **What:** Create a durable unmatched-demand entity that stores the need, alert state, follow-up status, and expiry.
  - **Why:** Zero-match recovery is a core survival mechanic, not a waitlist side path.
  - **Done when:** Unmatched requests can be created from zero-result flows and tracked through active, notified, matched, expired, and cancelled states.

- [ ] **D06** — Add `ConciergeOffer` to keep founder fulfilment on-platform
  - **File(s):** `new file: supabase/migrations/021_concierge_offers.sql`, `src/types/database.ts`, `src/lib/data/admin.ts`
  - **What:** Introduce a concierge-offer entity that links an unmatched request to an operator-sourced carrier and proposed price.
  - **Why:** The blueprint allows manual founder fulfilment only if it still flows through system entities and booking states.
  - **Done when:** Concierge offers can be created, tracked, and routed into the normal acceptance flow without off-platform bookkeeping.

- [ ] **D07** — Add `OperatorTask` for unmatched demand and stale-supply follow-up
  - **File(s):** `new file: supabase/migrations/022_operator_tasks.sql`, `src/types/database.ts`, `src/lib/data/admin.ts`
  - **What:** Create an operator-task model for unmatched requests, stale trip follow-up, and dispute/payout intervention work.
  - **Why:** The blueprint depends on a founder/operator queue to keep sparse supply and disputes alive.
  - **Done when:** Operator tasks can be generated, assigned, and resolved against unmatched requests and trust-critical incidents.

- [ ] **D08** — Reshape `Trip` for waypoints, route polyline, detour tolerance, recurrence, and freshness
  - **File(s):** `new file: supabase/migrations/023_trip_realignment.sql`, `src/types/trip.ts`, `src/lib/data/mappers.ts`
  - **What:** Extend the trip model to include route polyline data, up to two waypoints, recurrence metadata, detour tolerance, and freshness check-in fields.
  - **Why:** The current listing shape cannot fully support the blueprint’s matching, operations, and freshness rules.
  - **Done when:** Trip records can represent the route, tolerance, recurrence, and freshness signals the blueprint requires.

- [ ] **D09** — Replace booking and payment enums with the blueprint state machines
  - **File(s):** `new file: supabase/migrations/024_booking_state_realignment.sql`, `src/types/booking.ts`, `src/lib/status-machine.ts`
  - **What:** Introduce explicit booking, booking-request, and payment states that match the governing blueprint instead of the legacy direct-booking flow.
  - **Why:** State discipline is a product requirement, not a backend detail, and the current enums are too shallow.
  - **Done when:** TypeScript and database status enums align with the blueprint’s request, booking, payment, and unmatched-request transitions.

- [ ] **D10** — Store ratings as individual records with future display hooks
  - **File(s):** `new file: supabase/migrations/025_ratings_foundation.sql`, `src/types/review.ts`, `src/lib/data/feedback.ts`
  - **What:** Preserve per-rating records and tags so trust display can remain thin at MVP while supporting later review surfaces.
  - **Why:** The blueprint defers written-review display, but not structured trust data collection.
  - **Done when:** Rating storage supports star scores, structured tags, and future moderation/display without aggregate-only shortcuts.

- [ ] **D11** — Separate activation state from optional trust boosters
  - **File(s):** `new file: supabase/migrations/026_verification_levels.sql`, `src/types/carrier.ts`, `src/lib/data/carriers.ts`
  - **What:** Replace the simple `is_verified` model with explicit activation status plus optional ABN and insurance flags.
  - **Why:** The blueprint distinguishes hard activation gates from optional trust enrichment and the code should reflect that.
  - **Done when:** Carrier records can separately express unverified, activation started, pending review, active, suspended, ABN verified, and insurance uploaded states.

- [ ] **D12** — Add alert and notification preference fields for customers and carriers
  - **File(s):** `new file: supabase/migrations/027_alert_preferences.sql`, `src/types/customer.ts`, `src/types/carrier.ts`
  - **What:** Add stored preferences for push, email, and in-app notifications tied to alerts, requests, and fulfilment events.
  - **Why:** Alert the Network and request-state flows rely on notification delivery as a core product behavior.
  - **Done when:** Preferences exist in schema and types and can gate downstream notification sends.

- [ ] **D13** — Add request clarification tracking with one-round enforcement
  - **File(s):** `new file: supabase/migrations/028_request_clarifications.sql`, `src/types/booking-request.ts`, `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`
  - **What:** Store clarification reasons, response state, and expiry so clarification stays factual and bounded.
  - **Why:** The blueprint permits clarification for missing facts but rejects negotiation gravity and repeated loops.
  - **Done when:** One clarification round can be persisted and cannot loop indefinitely.

- [ ] **D14** — Add trip freshness fields and suspension reasons
  - **File(s):** `new file: supabase/migrations/030_trip_freshness.sql`, `src/types/trip.ts`, `src/lib/data/trips.ts`
  - **What:** Add 24-hour and 2-hour check-in state, timestamps, and suspension reason storage to trips.
  - **Why:** The blueprint makes freshness enforcement mandatory to avoid stale supply poisoning trust.
  - **Done when:** Trip records support deprioritised and suspended freshness states with auditable reasons.

- [ ] **D15** — Add carrier-home mode derivation fields or presenters
  - **File(s):** `src/types/carrier.ts`, `src/lib/data/carriers.ts`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - **What:** Define how carrier home mode is derived from activation, live trips, pending requests, today work, proof blockers, and payout blockers.
  - **Why:** The blueprint treats the state-aware carrier home as a core product mechanic, not an ad hoc page heuristic.
  - **Done when:** Carrier home mode can be derived consistently in one place and consumed by page presenters.

- [ ] **D16** — Prepare compatibility types for a dual-read transition off legacy direct bookings
  - **File(s):** `src/types/booking.ts`, `src/types/trip.ts`, `src/lib/data/mappers.ts`
  - **What:** Introduce compatibility types that let current pages read legacy and realigned booking/trip records during migration.
  - **Why:** The codebase cannot jump straight from listings-plus-bookings to the target model without a safe transition layer.
  - **Done when:** Types and mappers can represent both legacy and new model states without unsafe casting or duplicated page logic.

### Booking and Marketplace Logic

- [ ] **A01** — Split direct booking creation into `MoveRequest -> Offer -> BookingRequest`
  - **File(s):** `src/app/api/bookings/route.ts`, `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/lib/validation/booking.ts`
  - **What:** Replace the direct booking write path with a staged flow that creates move requests, matches offers, and then creates booking requests.
  - **Why:** The blueprint’s marketplace model depends on explicit request and offer layers instead of skipping straight to a booking.
  - **Done when:** Booking creation no longer writes a confirmed booking from trip detail without a move-request and booking-request step.

- [ ] **A02** — Add atomic Fast Match accept-and-revoke flow
  - **File(s):** `new file: src/app/api/booking-requests/fast-match/route.ts`, `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/lib/status-machine.ts`
  - **What:** Implement Fast Match so one accepted request confirms the booking and atomically revokes sibling requests in the same group.
  - **Why:** Fast Match is a locked product mechanic and race conditions would break trust for customers and carriers.
  - **Done when:** The first accepted Fast Match request wins, siblings revoke atomically, and both sides receive the correct outcome notifications.

- [ ] **A03** — Introduce booking-request deadlines with a 12-hour default
  - **File(s):** `new file: src/app/api/booking-requests/route.ts`, `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/types/booking-request.ts`
  - **What:** Add explicit response deadlines that default to 12 hours and can extend to 24 hours for flexible bookings.
  - **Why:** The blueprint replaces the current 2-hour pending-booking assumption with a request-centric response model.
  - **Done when:** New booking requests store and enforce response deadlines that match the governing default behavior.

- [ ] **A04** — Persist deterministic `match_class` values on offers
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/trips.ts`, `src/lib/matching/score.ts`, `src/lib/trip-presenters.ts`
  - **What:** Generate and store match classes like `direct`, `near_pickup`, `near_dropoff`, `nearby_date`, and `needs_approval`.
  - **Why:** The blueprint requires deterministic explanation templates and grouped result sections built on match class.
  - **Done when:** Every surfaced offer has a stable match class that drives explanation text and result grouping.

- [ ] **A05** — Persist fit-confidence output as a first-class match result
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/matching/score.ts`, `src/lib/trip-presenters.ts`, `src/types/trip.ts`
  - **What:** Replace ad hoc score interpretation with explicit `likely_fits`, `review_photos`, and `needs_approval` outputs.
  - **Why:** The customer-facing fit label is a required, explainable contract in the governing product.
  - **Done when:** Fit-confidence values are computed, stored, and rendered consistently across results, details, and request flows.

- [ ] **A06** — Replace search waitlist POST behavior with unmatched-request creation
  - **File(s):** `src/app/api/search/route.ts`, `new file: src/app/api/unmatched-requests/route.ts`, `src/components/customer/waitlist-form.tsx`
  - **What:** Remove the waitlist-style POST path and create an unmatched request whenever zero-match recovery is triggered.
  - **Why:** Alert the Network is an active demand-capture flow, not a passive waitlist.
  - **Done when:** Zero-match demand is stored as unmatched requests and no production flow writes a waitlist entry for customer recovery.

- [ ] **A07** — Add Alert the Network orchestration on zero-match outcomes
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/trips.ts`, `src/lib/notifications.ts`, `new file: src/lib/data/unmatched-requests.ts`
  - **What:** Trigger carrier nudges, rematch subscriptions, and customer alerts when a move request has no viable offer set.
  - **Why:** The blueprint makes zero-match recovery a mandatory continuation path instead of a dead end.
  - **Done when:** A zero-match move request creates unmatched demand, notifies relevant carriers, and subscribes the customer for follow-up.

- [ ] **A08** — Add concierge-offer acceptance inside the normal booking flow
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/admin.ts`, `new file: src/lib/data/concierge-offers.ts`, `src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - **What:** Route operator-created concierge matches into the same booking-request and booking flow used for normal marketplace fulfilment.
  - **Why:** Founder concierge is allowed only if it does not create shadow ops or off-platform transaction paths.
  - **Done when:** Concierge offers can be created, accepted, and fulfilled without bypassing core payment, proof, or payout logic.

- [ ] **A09** — Add a factual clarification path distinct from condition adjustment
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `new file: src/lib/validation/booking-request.ts`, `src/types/booking-request.ts`
  - **What:** Support one clarification round for missing or contradictory facts before accept or decline, without price bargaining.
  - **Why:** The blueprint allows factual clarification but rejects freeform message loops and negotiation gravity.
  - **Done when:** Carriers can request clarification for predefined reasons and customers can answer once before the request resolves.

- [ ] **A10** — Enforce one-round condition adjustments with predefined reason codes and amounts
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/lib/status-machine.ts`, `src/types/condition-adjustment.ts`
  - **What:** Limit condition adjustments to one structured round with controlled reasons and allowed amounts.
  - **Why:** The blueprint allows realism for misdescribed conditions without opening counterproposal loops.
  - **Done when:** The product blocks a second adjustment round and only allows platform-defined adjustment reasons and amounts.

- [ ] **A11** — Reshape payment lifecycle around authorization, capture, hold, release, and paid states
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/lib/stripe/payment-actions.ts`, `src/types/booking.ts`
  - **What:** Replace the simplified payment model with blueprint-aligned request authorization, capture on accept, held funds, pending confirmation, release, and paid states.
  - **Why:** The current payment state model is too shallow to express the trust and payout mechanics the blueprint depends on.
  - **Done when:** Payment state transitions map cleanly to the request, proof, dispute, and payout lifecycle in code and persisted records.

- [ ] **A12** — Reshape payout release around valid proof plus a 72-hour dispute window
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/lib/status-machine.ts`, `src/components/booking/confirm-receipt-button.tsx`
  - **What:** Update payout eligibility, auto-release timing, and blocked-state handling to match the 72-hour post-proof window in the governing blueprint.
  - **Why:** The codebase still mixes older payout timing assumptions and needs one consistent trust contract.
  - **Done when:** Payout release waits for customer confirmation or 72 hours after valid proof with no dispute, and blocks correctly on disputes.

### Pricing / Negotiation / Quoting

- [ ] **A13** — Replace the flat booking-fee pricing invariant with the blueprint pricing contract
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/pricing/breakdown.ts`, `src/lib/__tests__/breakdown.test.ts`, `.agent-skills/PRICING.md`
  - **What:** Rewrite pricing helpers and tests so customer totals are built from base price, structured add-ons, platform fee, and GST instead of a flat `$5` fee.
  - **Why:** The governing blueprint supersedes the older booking-fee model and the backlog must treat that as a hard correction.
  - **Done when:** Pricing code, tests, and local guidance all describe the same blueprint-aligned customer total and carrier payout math.

- [ ] **A14** — Flag detour-pricing ambiguity and block automatic detour-cost implementation pending founder decision
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/pricing/breakdown.ts`, `.agent-skills/PRICING.md`, `README.md`
  - **What:** Add an explicit backlog and code-contract guard that allows detour estimation for matching but prevents silent rollout of automatic detour pricing.
  - **Why:** The blueprint is internally inconsistent on detour pricing and this needs an explicit decision instead of accidental implementation drift.
  - **Done when:** Pricing code paths and docs treat detour pricing as blocked behind an explicit founder decision rather than assumed behavior.

- [ ] **A15** — Enforce total all-in pricing on every offer card
  - **File(s):** `src/components/trip/trip-card.tsx`, `src/components/trip/trip-detail-summary.tsx`, `src/components/booking/price-breakdown.tsx`
  - **What:** Make offer cards, detail pages, and request confirmation surfaces render the same total customer price contract, including required fees and GST.
  - **Why:** Price transparency on first impression is a non-negotiable product rule in the blueprint.
  - **Done when:** Offer cards, detail pages, and confirmation steps all render the same total price without "starting from" or base-only shortcuts.

- [ ] **A16** — Separate hard activation gates from optional trust boosters in trust displays
  - **File(s):** `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/onboarding/page.tsx`, `src/components/carrier/carrier-trust-panel.tsx`, `src/types/carrier.ts`
  - **What:** Ensure trust displays distinguish mandatory activation completion from optional ABN and insurance badges.
  - **Why:** The blueprint treats identity, vehicle, rules, and payout as gates while leaving ABN and insurance as optional enrichment.
  - **Done when:** Carrier trust and gating UI never imply optional trust boosters are required to go live.

- [ ] **A17** — Block publication and acceptance using activation status rather than a single `is_verified` flag
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/carriers.ts`, `src/app/api/trips/route.ts`, `src/app/api/booking-requests/[id]/route.ts`
  - **What:** Move publication and acceptance guards onto explicit activation status instead of the legacy boolean verification shortcut.
  - **Why:** The governing product needs more precise gating semantics than a single flag can express.
  - **Done when:** Trip publishing and request acceptance are denied unless the carrier is in the active activation state.

### Carrier Experience

- [ ] **B11** — Add a dedicated carrier Requests route
  - **File(s):** `new file: src/app/(carrier)/carrier/requests/page.tsx`, `src/components/layout/site-header.tsx`, `src/components/layout/mobile-nav.tsx`
  - **What:** Create a first-class Requests page for pending booking decisions and clarification actions.
  - **Why:** The blueprint calls Requests a separate high-urgency tab, not a hidden fragment of Home.
  - **Done when:** Carriers can open a dedicated Requests page from primary navigation and see pending decisions there.

- [ ] **B12** — Remove the carrier stats page from primary MVP IA
  - **File(s):** `src/components/layout/site-header.tsx`, `src/components/layout/mobile-nav.tsx`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/stats/page.tsx`
  - **What:** Remove Stats from primary carrier navigation and demote the page behind deferred or admin-only access.
  - **Why:** The blueprint explicitly rejects analytics-first carrier navigation in MVP.
  - **Done when:** Carrier primary navigation no longer includes Stats and the page is not used as a core workflow.

- [ ] **B13** — Rebuild carrier home hero priority around urgent action states
  - **File(s):** `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/dashboard/page.tsx`, `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/components/carrier/live-bookings-list.tsx`
  - **What:** Restructure carrier home so the hero always chooses between pending request, today work, proof needed, or payout blocked in that order.
  - **Why:** The governing blueprint defines the carrier home as a work queue disguised as a dashboard.
  - **Done when:** Carrier home surfaces the highest-priority action item first and de-emphasizes summary analytics.

- [ ] **B14** — Add a customer Alerts route to replace Saved searches
  - **File(s):** `new file: src/app/(customer)/alerts/page.tsx`, `src/components/layout/site-header.tsx`, `src/components/layout/mobile-nav.tsx`
  - **What:** Create an Alerts page for unmatched demand, matched alerts, and expired alert history.
  - **Why:** The blueprint’s no-match model is alert-driven and needs a first-class customer destination.
  - **Done when:** Customers have an Alerts page in primary navigation and no primary nav item says Saved searches.

### Admin / Operator Tooling

- [ ] **A18** — Add an operator queue for unmatched demand and stale-supply follow-up
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/admin.ts`, `new file: src/lib/data/operator-tasks.ts`, `new file: src/app/(admin)/admin/alerts/page.tsx`
  - **What:** Create admin queries and a dedicated view for unmatched requests, stale trips, and manual follow-up actions.
  - **Why:** Sparse-supply MVP depends on founder/operator intervention being visible, structured, and auditable.
  - **Done when:** Admin can view and act on unmatched demand and stale-supply tasks in one operator queue.

- [ ] **A19** — Enforce trip freshness suspension in matching eligibility
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/trips.ts`, `src/lib/matching/filter.ts`, `src/app/api/search/route.ts`
  - **What:** Exclude or deprioritise trips that miss freshness check-ins based on the 24-hour and 2-hour blueprint rules.
  - **Why:** Stale supply is a trust-breaking failure mode that the product must handle upstream.
  - **Done when:** Unconfirmed trips are deprioritised and 2-hour no-response trips are suspended before they can surface in results.

## 🟠 P1 — User-Facing Bugs

### Customer Experience

- [ ] **B15** — Build the four-step need-declaration wizard on the home surface
  - **File(s):** `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/components/search/search-bar.tsx`, `src/lib/validation/booking.ts`
  - **What:** Replace the current generic search form with a four-step route, item, timing, and access wizard.
  - **Why:** The blueprint makes structured need declaration the first customer action and the foundation of quality matching.
  - **Done when:** Customers can declare route, item, timing, and access in a linear wizard before any results are shown.

- [ ] **B16** — Persist move-request draft state across wizard steps and returns
  - **File(s):** `src/components/search/search-bar.tsx`, `new file: src/hooks/useMoveRequestDraft.ts`, `src/app/page.tsx`
  - **What:** Save and restore partially completed move-request inputs so the customer can resume a need declaration without re-entry.
  - **Why:** Sparse-supply validation depends on not losing intent during a longer, more structured intake flow.
  - **Done when:** Moving between steps, leaving the page, and returning restores the in-progress move request safely.

- [ ] **B17** — Require structured place selection for both route endpoints
  - **File(s):** `src/components/search/search-bar.tsx`, `src/components/shared/google-autocomplete-input.tsx`, `src/lib/validation/booking.ts`
  - **What:** Require resolvable pickup and drop-off place data instead of loose suburb text before matching proceeds.
  - **Why:** The matching pipeline in the blueprint depends on real endpoint data, not approximate text-only guesses.
  - **Done when:** The wizard blocks progression until both route endpoints resolve to structured place data.

- [ ] **B18** — Replace item free-text-first entry with category, variant, and quantity selection
  - **File(s):** `src/components/search/search-bar.tsx`, `src/components/booking/booking-form.tsx`, `src/types/trip.ts`
  - **What:** Add structured item category, variant, and quantity entry as the main item-declaration path.
  - **Why:** The blueprint rejects free-text-first item capture because it weakens fit confidence and pricing trust.
  - **Done when:** Customers choose a structured category and variant before any optional free-text notes appear.

- [ ] **B19** — Make bulky-item photo upload mandatory before request submission
  - **File(s):** `src/components/booking/booking-form.tsx`, `src/app/api/upload/route.ts`, `src/lib/validation/booking.ts`
  - **What:** Enforce required photo upload for bulky categories during the request flow rather than leaving it optional.
  - **Why:** Photo-backed truth is a core guardrail against fit failures and day-of-job disputes.
  - **Done when:** Large Furniture, Appliances, Sporting / Outdoor, Mattress / Bed, and Other cannot submit without the required photo evidence.

- [ ] **B20** — Move structured access questions ahead of results and make them mandatory
  - **File(s):** `src/components/search/search-bar.tsx`, `src/lib/validation/booking.ts`, `src/app/(customer)/search/page.tsx`
  - **What:** Collect stairs, lift, helper, and parking state before the results request is made.
  - **Why:** The blueprint makes access truth part of matching eligibility, not a booking afterthought.
  - **Done when:** Results cannot load until the access step is complete and the request payload includes structured access facts.

- [ ] **B21** — Group search results into Top Matches, Possible Matches, and Nearby Dates
  - **File(s):** `src/app/(customer)/search/page.tsx`, `src/lib/data/trips.ts`, `src/components/trip/trip-card.tsx`
  - **What:** Replace the flat result list with blueprint-defined grouped sections based on match class and timing offset.
  - **Why:** The product should return an answer set, not a generic listing archive.
  - **Done when:** Search results render grouped sections with the correct offer membership and empty-state fallbacks.

- [ ] **B22** — Collapse Possible Matches and Nearby Dates by default
  - **File(s):** `src/app/(customer)/search/page.tsx`, `src/components/trip/trip-card.tsx`, `src/components/search/search-results-skeleton.tsx`
  - **What:** Keep weaker or offset offers collapsed until the customer expands them intentionally.
  - **Why:** The blueprint wants the strongest recommendations to lead without overwhelming customers with weaker supply.
  - **Done when:** Possible Matches and Nearby Dates render collapsed-by-default expansion rows on first load.

- [ ] **B23** — Generate and render "Why this matches" on every offer card
  - **File(s):** `src/components/trip/trip-card.tsx`, `src/lib/trip-presenters.ts`, `src/lib/data/trips.ts`
  - **What:** Add the deterministic explanation line to every surfaced offer card and remove cards that cannot explain themselves.
  - **Why:** Match explanation is a non-negotiable product rule and key trust mechanic.
  - **Done when:** Every result card contains a plain-language explanation derived from the offer’s match class and timing fit.

- [ ] **B24** — Replace current fit labels with the blueprint confidence language
  - **File(s):** `src/components/trip/trip-card.tsx`, `src/lib/matching/score.ts`, `src/lib/trip-presenters.ts`
  - **What:** Replace score-style or loose route-fit labels with `Likely fits`, `Review photos`, and `Needs approval`.
  - **Why:** The governing product chooses human fit confidence over opaque score-driven wording.

  - **What:** Restructure booking confirmation into item, access, price, payment, and request-submitted stages with blueprint-aligned validations.
  - **Why:** The current long-form booking flow is listing-first and does not mirror the need-first request flow.
  - **Done when:** Customers move through staged confirmation screens that prefill from the move request and end in request submission.

- [ ] **B31** — Update the customer booking timeline to the blueprint booking states
  - **File(s):** `src/app/(customer)/bookings/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/components/booking/booking-status-stepper.tsx`, `src/types/booking.ts`

  - **What:** Add a reusable state-card component for high-signal marketplace states that need clear actions and explanations.
  - **Why:** Blueprint flows depend on a handful of recurring high-importance states and should not re-solve them page by page.
  - **Done when:** Core state surfaces reuse a shared pattern for layout, emphasis, and CTA placement.

- [ ] **V03** — Reduce section-label overuse on customer and carrier operational pages
  - **File(s):** `src/app/globals.css`, `src/app/(customer)/search/page.tsx`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - **What:** Cut repetitive eyebrow labels so headings and state changes regain visual meaning.
  - **Why:** Overusing section labels flattens information hierarchy on already dense operational pages.

  - **What:** Standardize how primary and secondary CTAs stack on mobile across request, alert, proof, and payout surfaces.
  - **Why:** The blueprint depends on one dominant action per screen and CTA order should reinforce that.
  - **Done when:** Mobile CTA ordering is consistent across core customer and carrier flows.

- [ ] **V07** — Add skeletons for wizard, results, requests, and alerts that preserve layout meaning
  - **File(s):** `src/components/search/search-results-skeleton.tsx`, `src/components/carrier/trip-list-skeleton.tsx`, `new file: src/components/search/alerts-skeleton.tsx`

### Hardening / Edge Cases

- [ ] **A39** — Handle move-request expiry and reactivation without losing alert history
  - **File(s):** `new file: src/lib/data/move-requests.ts`, `new file: src/lib/data/unmatched-requests.ts`, `src/types/move-request.ts`
  - **What:** Define how stale move requests expire, reactivate, or clone into new requests without dropping their alert and match history.
  - **Why:** Need persistence and recovery are central to sparse-supply behavior and cannot rely on ephemeral form state.
  - **Done when:** Expired move requests can be reactivated or duplicated in a controlled way without corrupting alert state.

- [ ] **A40** — Handle all-Fast-Match-declined outcomes by routing into alert capture
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/lib/notifications.ts`, `new file: src/lib/data/unmatched-requests.ts`
  - **What:** Define the post-failure path when all Fast Match requests decline or expire so the customer lands in alert recovery instead of a dead end.
  - **Why:** Fast Match exists to reduce latency, but it still needs a clear sparse-supply fallback.
  - **Done when:** Failed Fast Match groups automatically transition customers into the correct recovery flow.

- [ ] **A41** — Handle clarification expiry when the customer never responds
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/lib/status-machine.ts`, `src/types/booking-request.ts`
  - **What:** Add explicit expiry and follow-on behavior for clarification requests that receive no customer response.
  - **Why:** Clarification is bounded in the blueprint and cannot become an indefinite limbo state.
  - **Done when:** Clarification requests expire cleanly and move the request into the correct follow-up outcome.

- [ ] **A42** — Recompute offer pricing previews when access facts change before submission
  - **File(s):** `src/components/booking/booking-form.tsx`, `src/lib/pricing/breakdown.ts`, `src/lib/data/trips.ts`
  - **What:** Update offer and confirmation pricing previews whenever the customer changes structured access facts during confirmation.
  - **Why:** The blueprint promises deterministic pricing from structured inputs and requires real-time recalculation before commitment.
  - **Done when:** Editing access facts in confirmation updates the total and breakdown before the request is submitted.

- [ ] **A43** — Block request creation when required bulky-item photos are missing
  - **File(s):** `src/components/booking/booking-form.tsx`, `src/app/api/upload/route.ts`, `src/lib/validation/move-request.ts`
  - **What:** Add explicit blocking validation and UI treatment for missing required photos on bulky-item flows.
  - **Why:** Photo truth is a core trust and fit control and should fail loudly before request creation.
  - **Done when:** Missing required bulky-item photos produce a blocking validation state with a clear next action.

- [ ] **A44** — Add structured decline reasons without turning declines into free-text support work
  - **File(s):** `src/components/carrier/pending-bookings-alert.tsx`, `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/types/booking-request.ts`

- [ ] **A46** — Invalidate stale offers when a trip changes after results were shown
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/trips.ts`, `new file: src/lib/data/offers.ts`, `src/app/(customer)/search/page.tsx`
  - **What:** Expire or regenerate offers when the underlying trip route, pricing, capacity, or constraints change materially.
  - **Why:** Offer truth must remain trustworthy if carriers edit or lose availability after a customer has already seen a match.
  - **Done when:** Stale offers cannot be requested without a refresh and the customer receives a clear reload path.

### Technical Debt / Cleanup

- [ ] **A47** — Replace ad hoc result-breakdown structures with a single offer presenter contract
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/trips.ts`, `src/lib/trip-presenters.ts`, `src/types/trip.ts`
  - **What:** Consolidate how route fit, detour, pricing preview, and trust data are prepared for customer offer rendering.
  - **Why:** Realigned results logic will sprawl quickly if presenters and API responses diverge by surface.

- [ ] **A48** — Replace listing-first terminology in presenter utilities and constants
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/trip-presenters.ts`, `src/lib/constants.ts`, `src/lib/data/mappers.ts`
  - **What:** Rename helpers and constants that still encode listing-first or inventory-first semantics.
  - **Why:** Internal terminology guides future implementation choices and should reflect the blueprint model.
  - **Done when:** Core presenter and constant names prefer trip, offer, move request, and alert language over inventory language.

- [ ] **A49** — Replace saved-search-specific notification naming with alert naming
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/notifications.ts`, `src/lib/data/saved-searches.ts`, `src/lib/email/index.ts`
  - **What:** Rename notification templates, event names, and helpers so alert capture replaces saved-search semantics in the codebase.
  - **Why:** Notification naming should describe the active no-match loop the product actually uses.
  - **Done when:** Notification helpers and template names reference alerts and unmatched demand instead of saved searches.

- [ ] **A50** — Remove browse-first analytics events that no longer map to the product model
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/analytics.ts`, `src/app/api/search/route.ts`, `src/app/api/bookings/route.ts`
  - **What:** Remove or rename analytics events that assume browse-first inventory, direct booking, or saved-search semantics.
  - **Why:** Measurement should reflect the governing product funnel or later data interpretation will drift.
  - **Done when:** Core analytics events map to move request, offers, booking requests, alerts, and fulfilment rather than browse-first shortcuts.

- [ ] **A51** — Consolidate customer draft state around `MoveRequest`
  - **File(s):** `src/components/search/search-bar.tsx`, `src/components/booking/booking-form.tsx`, `new file: src/hooks/useMoveRequestDraft.ts`
  - **What:** Collapse duplicated draft logic into a shared move-request draft layer used by home, results, and confirmation flows.
  - **Why:** The current search-draft and booking-draft split does not fit the need-first request model.
  - **Done when:** Customer draft state is managed through one move-request-oriented abstraction rather than separate search and booking drafts.

- [ ] **A52** — Consolidate carrier action derivation for Home, Requests, Trips, and Today
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/lib/data/carriers.ts`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - **What:** Centralize how carrier next actions are derived so multiple pages do not compute urgency and state differently.
  - **Why:** The state-aware carrier experience will drift fast if each page invents its own action logic.
  - **Done when:** Carrier next-action derivation lives in one reusable layer consumed across operational surfaces.

  - **What:** Expand notification fanout so request, alert, proof, payout, and freshness events share one event-driven model.
  - **Why:** The realigned product introduces more stateful events and needs a predictable notification layer.
  - **Done when:** The notification layer can fan out the full blueprint event set from one event-driven contract.

- [ ] **A54** — Add email templates for request accepted, request declined, alert matched, trip suspended, and payout released
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/email/index.ts`, `src/lib/notifications.ts`, `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`
  - **What:** Create missing lifecycle templates for the new request, alert, and freshness events.
  - **Why:** The blueprint relies on clear lifecycle communication, especially when supply is sparse or state changes are delayed.

- [ ] **A57** — Add reusable geospatial helpers for corridor overlap and partial-route labels
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/maps/directions.ts`, `src/lib/maps/distance.ts`, `src/lib/data/trips.ts`
  - **What:** Create shared helpers for corridor overlap, partial-route percentage, and route-fit labeling instead of ad hoc calculations.
  - **Why:** Matching logic will need consistent geospatial semantics across offers, alerts, and admin surfaces.
  - **Done when:** Corridor overlap and partial-route helpers are reusable and power customer-facing match labels consistently.

- [ ] **A58** — Add cached detour estimation for top candidates only
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/maps/directions.ts`, `src/lib/data/trips.ts`, `src/lib/matching/score.ts`
  - **What:** Add cached detour estimation so the system can explain top candidates without turning every search into a full routing burst.
  - **Why:** The blueprint allows lightweight detour estimation but does not want a heavy route-optimization engine.
  - **Done when:** Detour estimates are cached for surfaced candidates and not recomputed wastefully on every request.

### Hardening / Edge Cases

- [ ] **D17** — Add RLS policies for new move-request, offer, booking-request, alert, and operator tables
  - **File(s):** `new file: supabase/migrations/031_realignment_rls.sql`, `src/types/database.ts`, `supabase/migrations/004_create_rls_policies.sql`
  - **What:** Apply row-level security for every new realignment table and align access with customer, carrier, admin, and service-role boundaries.
  - **Why:** Every new trust-critical table needs RLS, especially when founder concierge and notifications are involved.
  - **Done when:** All new tables have explicit RLS policies and policy coverage matches the realigned roles.

- [ ] **D18** — Add GIST indexes for new geography columns and route polylines
  - **File(s):** `new file: supabase/migrations/032_realignment_geo_indexes.sql`, `src/types/database.ts`, `supabase/migrations/005_create_indexes.sql`
  - **What:** Add the required geospatial indexes for move-request points, unmatched requests, and realigned trip route geometry.
  - **Why:** The matching and alert system cannot scale or stay correct without the right spatial indexes.
  - **Done when:** All new geography and line geometry columns have the required GIST indexes.

- [ ] **D19** — Correct migration sequencing before adding realignment migrations
  - **File(s):** `supabase/migrations/010_capacity_recalculation.sql`, `supabase/migrations/010_saved_searches.sql`, `new file: supabase/migrations/033_fix_migration_sequence.sql`
  - **What:** Resolve the duplicate `010` migration numbering so future realignment migrations can apply predictably.
  - **Why:** Sequential migration integrity is a repository rule and the current duplicate numbering is a latent deployment risk.
  - **Done when:** Migration ordering is unambiguous and future realignment migrations can be added without sequence collisions.

- [ ] **D20** — Add a backfill plan for migrating live listing and booking data into request-based entities
  - **File(s):** `new file: supabase/migrations/034_backfill_request_entities.sql`, `src/lib/data/mappers.ts`, `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`
  - **What:** Define how legacy listings and bookings are backfilled into move requests, offers, and booking requests without losing continuity.
  - **Why:** The model realignment needs a path from existing data to new entities or rollout will stall.
  - **Done when:** A backfill migration or scripted path exists for core historical data needed by the new model.

- [ ] **D21** — Add a dual-read compatibility layer during the legacy-to-realigned transition
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/lib/data/trips.ts`, `src/lib/data/mappers.ts`
  - **What:** Allow read paths to serve legacy and new model records during the transition period.
  - **Why:** A cold switch would break live screens before the new model is fully rolled out.
  - **Done when:** Core read paths can tolerate legacy and realigned records until cutover is complete.

- [ ] **A59** — Add feature flags for home, results, request-flow, and alert switchover
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/env.ts`, `next.config.js`, `src/app/page.tsx`
  - **What:** Gate the main flow transitions behind explicit feature flags so rollout can happen in bounded slices.
  - **Why:** A large product-shape realignment needs controlled rollout points to reduce blast radius.
  - **Done when:** Home, results, request flow, and alerts can be toggled independently through config or env flags.

- [ ] **A60** — Add a shadow-write path for new request entities before legacy write removal
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `new file: src/lib/data/move-requests.ts`, `new file: src/lib/data/offers.ts`
  - **What:** Write new move-request and offer records alongside the legacy flow before cutting legacy writes entirely.
  - **Why:** Shadow writes let the team validate the new model without breaking live screens immediately.
  - **Done when:** Legacy booking creation can optionally shadow-write the new entities for validation and comparison.

- [ ] **A61** — Add a guard so legacy search fallback cannot regress to a dead-end waitlist
  - **File(s):** `src/app/(customer)/search/page.tsx`, `src/app/api/search/route.ts`, `src/lib/data/unmatched-requests.ts`
  - **What:** Block any path that would drop a customer into a dead-end empty state or legacy waitlist behavior during the transition.
  - **Why:** Zero-match continuation is one of the most important product corrections in the realignment.
  - **Done when:** Search fallback always routes into near matches, nearby dates, or alert capture even during mixed-model rollout.

- [ ] **A62** — Validate proof records for GPS and timestamp before payout-pending state
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/types/booking.ts`, `src/components/booking/private-proof-tile.tsx`
  - **What:** Enforce proof metadata requirements before the system can move into payout-pending confirmation.
  - **Why:** The blueprint’s trust model depends on valid proof, not just uploaded images.
  - **Done when:** Proof uploads must contain required metadata before they can unlock the payout-pending state.

- [ ] **A63** — Add the payout auto-release scheduler with dispute-window enforcement
  - **File(s):** `new file: src/app/api/cron/payout-auto-release/route.ts`, `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `vercel.json`
  - **What:** Schedule auto-release of payouts after valid proof and 72 hours without dispute.
  - **Why:** The product’s payout promise is incomplete unless the auto-release path runs automatically and predictably.
  - **Done when:** Auto-release runs on schedule, respects disputes, and updates payout state without manual intervention.

- [ ] **A64** — Add 24-hour and 2-hour trip-freshness schedulers
  - **File(s):** `new file: src/app/api/cron/trip-freshness-checks/route.ts`, `src/lib/data/trips.ts`, `vercel.json`
  - **What:** Schedule freshness reminders, deprioritisation, and suspension actions around the blueprint check-in rules.
  - **Why:** Freshness enforcement is mandatory and cannot depend on page loads or manual review alone.
  - **Done when:** The platform sends check-ins and applies deprioritisation or suspension based on missed responses.

### Technical Debt / Cleanup

- [ ] **A65** — Remove legacy waitlist writes once `UnmatchedRequest` is live
  - **File(s):** `src/app/api/search/route.ts`, `src/components/customer/waitlist-form.tsx`, `supabase/migrations/006_extend_marketplace_infra.sql`
  - **What:** Delete legacy waitlist write paths after unmatched-demand flow is fully available.
  - **Why:** Keeping two zero-match persistence models alive will create product and reporting drift.
  - **Done when:** No production code writes waitlist entries for customer demand capture.

- [ ] **A66** — Remove legacy saved-search matcher once alerts cover rematch behavior
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/saved-searches.ts`, `src/app/api/saved-searches/route.ts`, `src/app/api/saved-searches/[id]/route.ts`
  - **What:** Retire saved-search-specific rematch behavior after alerts and unmatched-demand rematching replace it.
  - **Why:** Two rematch systems will compete conceptually and operationally if they remain live together.
  - **Done when:** Alert-based rematching is the only live rematch path and saved-search-specific matching code is removed.

- [ ] **A67** — Remove flat booking-fee helpers after the pricing contract is replaced
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/pricing/breakdown.ts`, `src/lib/trip-presenters.ts`, `src/components/trip/trip-detail-summary.tsx`
  - **What:** Delete helper names, presenter logic, and UI copy that depend on the flat booking-fee model once the new pricing model lands.
  - **Why:** Leaving the old pricing primitives in place will cause drift and accidental reintroduction later.
  - **Done when:** The codebase no longer carries flat booking-fee helper names or customer-facing references.

- [ ] **A68** — Remove direct customer-to-carrier phone fields from customer presenters
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/types/booking.ts`, `src/app/(customer)/bookings/[id]/page.tsx`
  - **What:** Stop mapping carrier phone fields into customer-facing presenter data for MVP flows.
  - **Why:** The blueprint’s on-platform communication rule should be reflected in data-presenter boundaries too.
  - **Done when:** Customer presenter payloads no longer include carrier phone data by default.

- [ ] **A69** — Remove public carrier listing shelves that bypass need-first entry
  - **File(s):** `src/app/(customer)/carrier/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/lib/data/trips.ts`
  - **What:** Remove or hide trip shelves whose main purpose is browsing a carrier’s public inventory.
  - **Why:** Inventory shelves on profile-like pages preserve a browse-first loop the blueprint rejects.
  - **Done when:** Public carrier surfaces no longer function as alternative browsing entry points to live supply.

- [ ] **A70** — Remove percentage-capacity copy helpers from customer presenters
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/trip-presenters.ts`, `src/components/trip/trip-card.tsx`, `src/components/trip/trip-detail-summary.tsx`
  - **What:** Delete presenter helpers that convert raw remaining-capacity percentages directly into customer-facing copy.
  - **Why:** The blueprint wants human fit language, not percentage-led capacity explanations.
  - **Done when:** Customer-facing presenter helpers no longer expose percentage-capacity phrasing directly.

- [ ] **A71** — Rename listing-centric modules toward trip, offer, request, and alert language
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/listings.ts`, `src/lib/data/trips.ts`, `src/lib/data/mappers.ts`
  - **What:** Rename modules and helper boundaries that still encode listings as the primary product concept.
  - **Why:** Internal architecture should describe the realigned model so future work follows the right abstractions.
  - **Done when:** Core module names reflect trips, offers, booking requests, move requests, and alerts instead of generic listings.

- [ ] **A72** — Replace dashboard and stats language with command-centre and work-queue language
  - **File(s):** `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/dashboard/page.tsx`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/stats/page.tsx`, `src/components/layout/page-intro.tsx`
  - **What:** Remove dashboard and stats language from carrier-facing operational surfaces and replace it with work-queue language.
  - **Why:** Product language should reinforce action-led carrier behavior, not deferred analytics ambitions.
  - **Done when:** Carrier operational pages no longer describe themselves primarily through dashboard or stats framing.

## ⚪ P4 — Post-MVP / Deferred

### Deferred Later-Phase Items

- [ ] **E01** — Add a secondary corridor browse layer after liquidity supports it
  - **File(s):** `new file: src/app/(customer)/explore/page.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/lib/data/trips.ts`
  - **What:** Build a secondary corridor-explore surface only after the need-first flow proves out and supply density supports browsing.

- [ ] **E02** — Add richer public carrier storefront features after the core flow stabilizes
  - **File(s):** `src/app/(customer)/carrier/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/lib/data/feedback.ts`, `src/lib/trip-presenters.ts`
  - **What:** Consider richer carrier public profiles only after need-first matching, trust, and fulfilment loops are stable.
  - **Why:** Public storefront depth is not part of the MVP product shape and should not compete with request-led discovery.
  - **Done when:** Any expanded carrier profile work is explicitly built as a secondary trust surface, not a discovery path.

- [ ] **E03** — Add public written-review display after moderation policy and rating volume mature
  - **File(s):** `src/app/(customer)/carrier/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/lib/data/feedback.ts`, `src/types/review.ts`
  - **What:** Display written review text only after moderation policy, thresholds, and trust signals are robust enough.
  - **Why:** The blueprint defers written-review display while still collecting review data.
  - **Done when:** Public written reviews can be shown without undermining new-but-verified trust states.

- [ ] **E04** — Add double-blind review release for customer and carrier feedback
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/feedback.ts`, `src/components/booking/review-form.tsx`, `src/types/review.ts`
  - **What:** Introduce a delayed review-reveal model where reviews publish after both parties submit or the review window expires.
  - **Why:** This is a later trust enhancement and not required for MVP learning loops.
  - **Done when:** Review release can be configured to hold until both sides respond or the review window closes.

- [ ] **E05** — Add phone masking if on-platform coordination proves insufficient
  - **File(s):** `src/app/(customer)/bookings/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/lib/notifications.ts`, `src/types/booking.ts`
  - **What:** Introduce masked calling or relay contact if same-day coordination needs outgrow on-platform messaging.
  - **Why:** The blueprint defers telephony because it is costly and not core to the MVP model.
  - **Done when:** Phone masking can be enabled as a bounded coordination layer without exposing raw numbers.

- [ ] **E06** — Add live trip-day tracking with explicit privacy rules
  - **File(s):** `src/app/(customer)/bookings/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/today/page.tsx`, `src/lib/notifications.ts`
  - **What:** Consider live location tracking only after core request, proof, and payout mechanics are stable.
  - **Why:** The blueprint defers live tracking and does not want it to become the centerpiece feature.
  - **Done when:** Live tracking exists only as an explicit, bounded post-MVP add-on with clear privacy controls.

- [ ] **E07** — Add richer in-app messaging with structured chips and images
  - **File(s):** `new file: src/app/(customer)/messages/page.tsx`, `new file: src/app/(carrier)/carrier/messages/page.tsx`, `src/lib/notifications.ts`
  - **What:** Expand in-app messaging after the structured status-update model proves insufficient.
  - **Why:** The blueprint defers messaging depth and prefers structured coordination during MVP.
  - **Done when:** Messaging can support richer threads without replacing the structured coordination defaults.

- [ ] **E08** — Add carrier calendar sync for recurring runs
  - **File(s):** `src/components/carrier/carrier-trip-wizard.tsx`, `src/lib/data/trips.ts`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/account/page.tsx`
  - **What:** Integrate recurring trips with external calendar sync only after the core repeat-route loop is stable.
  - **Why:** Calendar integration is useful but not part of the MVP retention mechanic itself.
  - **Done when:** Carriers can optionally sync recurring runs with supported calendars.

- [ ] **E09** — Add richer carrier reliability analytics outside the operational home
  - **File(s):** `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/stats/page.tsx`, `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/lib/analytics.ts`
  - **What:** Reintroduce deeper acceptance, completion, and route-performance analytics after the action-led carrier home is stable.
  - **Why:** The blueprint defers deep analytics and keeps carrier focus on posting and fulfilment first.
  - **Done when:** A non-primary analytics surface can be enabled without distorting the carrier home model.

- [ ] **E10** — Add SMB account mode and customer business workflows
  - **File(s):** `src/types/customer.ts`, `src/app/(customer)/account/page.tsx`, `src/lib/data/move-requests.ts`
  - **What:** Add small-business account affordances and repeat-business workflows after the consumer wedge proves out.
  - **Why:** SMB-specific UI is explicitly deferred in the blueprint.
  - **Done when:** Business-mode workflows are additive and do not distort the core awkward-middle customer flow.

- [ ] **E11** — Add multi-user business and fleet accounts
  - **File(s):** `src/types/carrier.ts`, `src/types/customer.ts`, `new file: src/app/(carrier)/carrier/team/page.tsx`
  - **What:** Support teams, permissions, and shared operational ownership for carrier or business accounts.
  - **Why:** Team and fleet logic are out of MVP scope and would overcomplicate the current trust and state model.
  - **Done when:** Team accounts can be enabled without changing the single-operator default assumptions baked into MVP.

- [ ] **E12** — Add advanced multi-stop optimization beyond two waypoints
  - **File(s):** `src/types/trip.ts`, `src/lib/maps/directions.ts`, `src/components/carrier/carrier-trip-wizard.tsx`
  - **What:** Extend route planning and matching beyond the limited two-waypoint support reserved for MVP realism.
  - **Why:** The blueprint explicitly rejects route-optimization depth during the first phase.
  - **Done when:** Carriers can manage richer multi-stop patterns without converting the product into a dispatch planner.

- [ ] **E13** — Add historical-data-driven pricing guidance
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/pricing/suggest.ts`, `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/components/carrier/carrier-trip-wizard.tsx`
  - **What:** Replace seed-based pricing guidance with historical transaction models when enough data exists.
  - **Why:** Pricing guidance is helpful, but the blueprint treats it as advisory and secondary to carrier-set rates.
  - **Done when:** Pricing guidance can use real corridor and category history without becoming automatic pricing.

- [ ] **E14** — Add automated detour pricing only after an explicit founder decision
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/pricing/breakdown.ts`, `src/lib/maps/directions.ts`, `src/components/carrier/carrier-trip-wizard.tsx`
  - **What:** Implement automated detour pricing only if the detour ambiguity is resolved in favor of it and product-shape risks are accepted.
  - **Why:** The blueprint is internally inconsistent here and the MVP default should remain estimation-only until decided.
  - **Done when:** Detour pricing ships only behind an explicit founder decision and documented product guardrails.

- [ ] **E15** — Add a funded insurance or coverage product with defined policy terms
  - **File(s):** `src/app/(marketing)/trust/page.tsx`, `src/types/booking.ts`, `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`
  - **What:** Build an actual coverage product only after policy funding, limits, and operational handling are real.
  - **Why:** The blueprint rejects vague guarantee language without real operational backing.
  - **Done when:** Coverage can be marketed only because a defined, funded policy exists.

- [ ] **E16** — Add a self-serve dispute center after founder-led policy stabilizes
  - **File(s):** `src/app/(customer)/account/page.tsx`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/account/page.tsx`, `src/components/booking/dispute-form.tsx`
  - **What:** Expand dispute tooling into a richer self-serve centre after founder adjudication patterns settle.
  - **Why:** MVP disputes are intentionally founder-led and should not become a large product subsystem too early.
  - **Done when:** A richer dispute center can be layered on without weakening the simple MVP trust model.

- [ ] **E17** — Add a map-assisted explore layer as a secondary explanatory surface
  - **File(s):** `new file: src/app/(customer)/explore-map/page.tsx`, `src/lib/maps/directions.ts`, `src/lib/data/trips.ts`
  - **What:** Add a secondary explore-map surface only once enough supply exists to justify it.
  - **Why:** Maps explain but do not lead in the blueprint and should stay secondary even later.
  - **Done when:** Any map-led browsing is clearly secondary to the need-first flow and gated behind sufficient supply density.

- [ ] **E18** — Add enterprise reporting and export surfaces
  - **File(s):** `src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`, `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/payouts/page.tsx`, `src/lib/data/admin.ts`
  - **What:** Build export and reporting surfaces for larger-scale operators or business customers only after MVP workflows are proven.
  - **Why:** Enterprise reporting is explicitly deferred and should not compete with core marketplace execution now.
  - **Done when:** Reporting exports exist as a later-phase add-on rather than a current MVP deliverable.

- [ ] **E19** — Add national corridor expansion tooling beyond the launch region
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/maps/sydney-suburb-coords.ts`, `src/lib/data/trips.ts`, `src/app/page.tsx`
  - **What:** Expand location, corridor, and launch tooling beyond the initial operating region after the local wedge proves out.
  - **Why:** Geographic expansion is later-phase work and should not distract from the launch corridor strategy.
  - **Done when:** Corridor and location tooling can support broader geography without changing the core product model.

- [ ] **E20** — Add a cross-role account switcher for dual customer and carrier users
  - **File(s):** `src/types/customer.ts`, `src/types/carrier.ts`, `src/components/layout/site-header.tsx`
  - **What:** Build a role switcher for users who operate as both customer and carrier after the underlying dual-role architecture stabilizes.
  - **Why:** The blueprint wants the architecture to support dual roles but does not require the switching UI in MVP.
  - **Done when:** Dual-role users can switch contexts without separate accounts once the underlying role model is stable.

- [ ] **E21** — Add post-MVP carrier performance coaching surfaces
  - **File(s):** `src/app/(carrier)/carrier/stats/page.tsx`, `src/lib/data/bookings.ts`, `src/lib/analytics.ts`
  - **What:** Add coaching around acceptance, completion, route quality, and trust after the core posting and fulfilment loop is stable.
  - **Why:** Performance coaching is helpful later, but the blueprint keeps it behind operational execution during MVP.
  - **Done when:** Carrier coaching can be turned on without replacing Home or Requests as the main carrier focus.

- [ ] **E22** — Add a native iOS app after the web MVP loops stabilize
  - **File(s):** `README.md`, `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/components/layout/mobile-nav.tsx`
  - **What:** Plan and build a native iOS client only after the mobile web flow proves out for posting, requests, proof, and payouts.
  - **Why:** The blueprint treats the web MVP as the validation surface and defers native app work.
  - **Done when:** Native iOS work starts from a stable, blueprint-aligned web product instead of from the current transition state.

- [ ] **E23** — Add a native Android app after the web MVP loops stabilize
  - **File(s):** `README.md`, `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/components/layout/mobile-nav.tsx`
  - **What:** Plan and build a native Android client only after the web MVP and iOS prioritization decisions are validated.
  - **Why:** Native platform expansion is explicitly deferred and should follow, not lead, the web MVP.
  - **Done when:** Native Android work begins only after the web MVP model is stable and clearly worth carrying to a second client.
